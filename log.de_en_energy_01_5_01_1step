Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .

Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .

Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .

Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .

Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-47.485161): and this is not just a little bit of the case , but it &apos;s also a little bit of the way that we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-65.094345): and the great example of this is that the phot@@ oc@@ oc@@ oc@@ ri@@ ty of the universe is a very important part of the process , because it &apos;s a lot of material that &apos;s called the Large Hadron Collider .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-69.060867): this is a piece of paper that &apos;s just a little bit of the way that we can do , because it &apos;s a piece of information that &apos;s going to be able to understand how the universe works .

Predicted (-29.341272): the president of the Obama administration said , &quot; It &apos;s only enough to get it in the case .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-45.490971): if you think that you can get a new one , then you &apos;ll never be a lawyer -- and then it &apos;s a very successful case .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-54.737476): and the final thing is that the most important thing is , is , in fact , the last thing that we &apos;re not going to do is to say , &quot; Is the U.S. &quot; or the country ?
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-57.628326): and that &apos;s the most expensive thing to do , and the one that &apos;s going to be the most sophisticated thing that we &apos;ve done in the world is a nuclear waste .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-16.537380): and the story is , of course , the shape has been made .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-8.019251): and this is the same thing .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-7.286200): they have a great deal .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-25.909508): and the other side of the community , the more you know , the one I &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.247396): but how do you know that a single country ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-4.569165): AB : 14 .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-30.759426): because you &apos;re just going to be the guy who &apos;s going to get out of the air .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-53.539772): and the first thing that he &apos;s lost is that if you &apos;re not in the United States , it &apos;s still a lawyer , and that &apos;s the case of the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-18.008305): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with me , and I &apos;m going to take you through it .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-35.463890): try to understand the words of reality , but the reality of the world is not just going to be more complex than any other story .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.510067): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-93.438797): so I went to a little bit of a year @-@ old , and we went to the United States , and it was a very good @-@ looking , very serious , very serious , very serious , very old @-@ fashioned ,
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .

Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.540616): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-166.842865): and I had a lot of time , and we were working with a lot of people in the West , and I was able to go to the same country , and we had a little bit of the same , and then we had to go to the M@@ oo@@ b@@ ate and see what was called &quot; B@@ av@@ an , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; The New Yorker &quot; Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ us .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-5.851312): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-61.390331): so I &apos;m here , the only one of the two @-@ year @-@ old and @-@ old , and the former Soviet Union , which is a state of mine , in the United States .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-97.065086): but I &apos;m a lot of people who are trying to make sense of how to make it invisible and not to the world , but I think it &apos;s a wonderful way to bring the magic and the magic of the world , and to make it more powerful , to make it happen .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-88.676285): I &apos;d like to take a new day from the American and the full @-@ time @-@ to @-@ fight , a great man , a mon@@ archy , and it &apos;s called &quot; The Li@@ c@@ ing@@ n . &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-60.551109): and if the government is going to be a business party , and I &apos;m going to take a vote for the campaign , and I &apos;m going to ask him , &quot; What &apos;s the best one ? &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-33.855434): and this is what they call to the government to do , to make them more efficient than the citizens .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-122.612328): I &apos;m going to talk about the U.S. government , and we &apos;re going to try to get a look at the money that &apos;s going to be able to take a look at the local market , and we &apos;re not going to take the money from the U.S. , and the police , and the police are not going to be able to take away from the local market .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-37.039925): I think that the question I &apos;d like to go to the public in the &apos; 70s is a particularly interesting case .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-150.302795): and the people who are in the &apos; 60s , and the only way to do is to create a new kind of a local park , and we could create a re@@ ce@@ ding of the city , and then we could create a new re@@ alist in the middle of the city with an open @-@ source , un@@ can@@ al , and a non @-@ lethal weapon .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-128.056778): and I would like to take a look at this beautiful , and the most beautiful part of the world , to be able to take a look at the power of the country , to be able to read the &quot; The O@@ th@@ be@@ f &quot; in the &apos; 70s , and to give them the most important part of the country .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-26.524549): but in those things , you can get to that , you know , you can get to jail .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-14.962069): but I do it because I believe it &apos;s the only way to change .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-10.966234): that &apos;s my point . what is your lifestyle ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.022753): thank you .

Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-26.987099): David is my name . and I &apos;m sure that &apos;s where I &apos;m much more about the time .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-9.820177): so , for 10 years , they did .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-30.832895): so I think this is a little bit of a room that would have been put into my own backyard .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-10.688376): and I &apos;m a little bit more involved .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-33.811790): this is the first time that I can tell you , and I think , in a moment , you can see it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-34.787155): and many of them were so successful that I didn &apos;t even think this is what I &apos;d like to do in the morning .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-33.324196): I think it &apos;s very clear that I can put in a few minutes , because I think that &apos;s going to be the right thing .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-8.493093): and no one has to do it .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-18.785370): and the good thing is that they &apos;re not too good at them .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-50.783058): the only thing that &apos;s going to be in your head is , because if you &apos;re on your feet , you &apos;re not going to do anything else , I &apos;m going to do it .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.218760): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.043558): so why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-8.204200): that was a very embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-12.039947): so , I don &apos;t know how much this was .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-19.495636): a matter is a complicated , but it &apos;s a very powerful view .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.049486): I &apos;m sure that all of you have been in my head .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-16.952248): and this is a moment where I didn &apos;t even know any of my friend .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-44.331367): I was very afraid to go and see my father , and I was looking for the same kind of guy who was sitting in my pocket .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-87.895355): and as the men and the other side of the room , I think , there &apos;s no more important things that we can do , and I think it &apos;s a little bit more than the rest of our life , and it &apos;s not just a way to be able to do .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-19.136730): and to be honest , I &apos;m too happy to be in the future .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-13.050223): and I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , because I &apos;m a scientist .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-29.950661): I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , because I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s a hero .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-18.670013): I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be done on the other hand .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-8.882845): the first question is , &quot; What do you do in a dictionary ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-13.077332): I said , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not true .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-50.793831): the most important question is , if you &apos;re a lawyer , I think , you can actually be a very powerful part of the country , and it &apos;s a very important question .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-76.927048): now , in the last few years , we &apos;re not just a wonderful thing , and we &apos;re very interested in the beauty of the brain , and it &apos;s a very strong form of survival , and so we can &apos;t be able to do it .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-17.728094): and this is an architect , and it &apos;s worth me with it .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-83.449760): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit like this , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s going to have a lot of du@@ b@@ bling , and you know , &quot; H@@ ale .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-16.731106): and the first thing I do is you know , very simple .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-195.223557): but I &apos;m sure that the project is a single @-@ scale project that has been done with a number of years , and it &apos;s not only one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half percent of the people who have been left , and they &apos;re not just a single one @-@ by @-@ one @-@ by @-@ one @-@ one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ one @-@ half @-@ by @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ to @-@ to @-@ half @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ one @-@ half @-@ year @-@ year @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ day .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-29.846527): the next question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m a single one , will I be able to do it ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.375171): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t believe that I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-15.331184): so the other part of the question is , &quot; Well , I want to give you a little bit of that ? &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.575915): you know what ? you can do .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-51.055405): you can see the American dream of the U.S. , or the next year , or the American dream is , &quot; Hey , you know , that &apos;s a real problem .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-47.968330): and then , when you get to the top of this , I said , &quot; No , no , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , no , I &apos;m going to be going to win . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-60.841324): I don &apos;t want to be the best or the best selling or the English @-@ selling book , and the answer is , &quot; The New Yorker is a little bit of the U.S.
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-44.488796): and you &apos;ll say , if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the wrong thing , you &apos;re going to be able to get the word .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-14.292293): you can &apos;t understand it , and it &apos;s not the case of your life .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-34.333340): I &apos;m going to show you a new record of your brain , because you can &apos;t even have the same amount of time .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-138.866486): and if you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a piece of paper , and he &apos;s sitting here , and he &apos;s going to be able to see the next one , and he &apos;s going to go back to the back , and he &apos;s going to be able to see the first one , and the only way you &apos;re going to see here , &quot; The R@@ um , &quot; and the robot , &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .

Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-14.107634): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-5.352844): I didn &apos;t know what this is .
Predicted (-78.480736): and if you have a lot of money , you &apos;ll get a job , and you &apos;ll never see that if you &apos;re going to go back to the &apos; 80s , you can &apos;t see a good word , because you &apos;re going to have a good call .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-12.661841): the question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Is this ever possible ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-27.726574): but the photos are just pretty much , and it &apos;s just a little bit of the original one .

Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-79.776077): it &apos;s the kind of work that we &apos;ve been building on the wall , and the makers of the world -- and they &apos;re not using a bunch of drawings and the ones that are , and they &apos;re all familiar with them .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-17.261259): now , the other people say , &quot; Is it going to be good for me ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .

Ground Truth: in China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
Predicted (-20.834940): in fact , it was a very young country , and it was not too young .
Ground Truth: I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migr@@ ants .
Predicted (-82.592216): I would love to be a very difficult story , because I didn &apos;t think that it was a very difficult way to go to South Africa , and it was also a very clear case of the Western country , because it &apos;s not just as a natural commodity .
Ground Truth: so I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be re@@ patri@@ ated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
Predicted (-51.245876): but I was feeling a strong feeling of being in the middle of my life , and then I was going to be able to get a look at the wrong one .
Ground Truth: one day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interro@@ gation .
Predicted (-31.970783): I was a little bit of my father &apos;s head , and I was able to see the police in the United States .
Ground Truth: someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
Predicted (-42.748867): and he asked me to be a professional citizen , and he asked me to do this in my own terms of the same thing .
Ground Truth: I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .

Ground Truth: if anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be imprisoned and re@@ patri@@ ated .
Predicted (-23.315008): I would be completely wrong , and I would be able to get out of it .
Ground Truth: I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .

Ground Truth: even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
Predicted (-27.376276): they were too late , because they were finally re@@ united with the first one .
Ground Truth: these North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky .
Predicted (-15.627873): and the authorities were not quite a lot of this .
Ground Truth: every year , countless North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ patri@@ ated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Predicted (-50.572861): and in the United States , they &apos;re going to be killed by 3@@ 50,000 , and they &apos;re going to be able to stop in Germany .
Ground Truth: even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
Predicted (-30.228205): and for me , I &apos;m not too much in the West , because of many other people .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s tragic that North Kore@@ ans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .

Ground Truth: even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
Predicted (-32.089046): and as they &apos;ve been able to find a new story , it &apos;s made in the world that they can do .
Ground Truth: that &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Predicted (-38.149971): so , after the year I was working on a new way , I decided to go back to college , and I started to do this .
Ground Truth: sett@@ ling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
Predicted (-28.342533): I was on a farm , and I was afraid of what I &apos;d like to do .
Ground Truth: English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Predicted (-30.169661): in fact , I was born with a lot of important communication , so I decided to change my own story .
Ground Truth: also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .

Ground Truth: North Kore@@ ans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
Predicted (-20.882092): eighty @-@ year @-@ olds have a very hard position to tell the country .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .

Ground Truth: but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and j@@ ail@@ ed for illegal border crossing .

Ground Truth: the kind stranger symboli@@ zed new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Predicted (-97.884071): and the only way to help the public , the more he was told to be the family of the city , and the more he was told to be the support of the local community , and the women in the West .
Ground Truth: eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ united in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Predicted (-37.814449): so , after the first time , I was in my family , and I decided to be able to take a sense of self @-@ interest .

Predicted (-30.933104): the teachers who are working on the education of the community , and also help us learn from education .
Ground Truth: we can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
Predicted (-73.417786): so we can see the difference between the communities and the United States , and we can actually move to the street , and we can &apos;t even move through the city , and to give them a sense of the family .
Ground Truth: I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give asp@@ iring North Kore@@ ans a chance to pros@@ per with international support .

Ground Truth: when he sin@@ gs songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Predicted (-59.229599): when I play a film , I &apos;m not talking about his own , it &apos;s a little bit more like this , and he &apos;s not going to be a little bit of science .

Src: doch viele Leute stimmen nicht zu .
Ground Truth: but most people don &apos;t agree .
Predicted (-5.790150): but many people don &apos;t agree .
Ground Truth: and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and misunderstood .
Predicted (-37.488663): because , in fact , you can &apos;t see the difference in their own way , and they &apos;re not really going to be completely different .
Ground Truth: but what lifted my heart and strength@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
Predicted (-68.912155): but the identity of the country was so important , because it was the case that I had never seen before , and it was a very important thing , but it was that it was a very common sense .
Ground Truth: now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
Predicted (-71.978081): now , for example , the most important thing about this is that we &apos;re not talking about social networks , and the language of the brain is a lot of physical learning , and it &apos;s a lot of the physical skills .
Ground Truth: it manifest@@ s in each individual differently , hence why Rem@@ i is so different from Sam .

Predicted (-57.229637): he had his friends in his life , and he had a big relationship with his friends , and he was working on the same side of the world , and he was able to make a difference .
Ground Truth: and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Predicted (-13.034168): and as he was born , it was more and more complex .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Predicted (-86.859612): but the thing that he did was to take the idea of the world and the mon@@ ot@@ ings of a war , and a man who never had a good life , and no one had a different sense of being .
Ground Truth: extraordinary .

Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-32.098793): well , there &apos;s no doubt that I could have been in the experience of my life , and I remember how many of them are .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-57.470062): but I want to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I love to do with , is to be a sense of trust .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-38.074440): so the perception of the brain is that we can &apos;t see a lot of other people , and it &apos;s a bit more important .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-13.604774): it &apos;s just one way to say that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-43.387619): and I &apos;d like to say that if you have to be a friend and I can &apos;t be able to do it , and then it &apos;s a little bit wrong .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-10.310987): you can be a very powerful way .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-56.228165): because , if you &apos;re not a hero , we &apos;re all born , and we &apos;re all part of the story -- that &apos;s a gift that has a gift to us .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .

Predicted (-82.381226): and he was doing a film with a long @-@ term sequence , and he was able to take a piece of a piece of a piece of a p@@ ale , and a half @-@ pound cylinder .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-39.654022): but the time we &apos;re going to see a billion years , and a half a year , a million people are not going to be a different view of the universe .
Src: ich stelle Ihnen eine neue Art der Fotografie vor , die F@@ em@@ to @-@ Fotografie , eine neue Ab@@ bild@@ ungste@@ chnik , die so schnell ist , dass sie Zeit@@ lu@@ pen@@ aufnahmen von Licht in Bewegung erstellen kann .
Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-57.184265): I &apos;m going to show you a series of new tools that are now building a series of new materials that are actually made in the world , and it &apos;s a very difficult way to do .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-53.337704): so we can go through the camera and see the lights on our own , and we can &apos;t see the light from the back of our own room , and see what &apos;s going on ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-127.110260): so if I can take a picture of a magnetic field , I &apos;m going to take a little bit of a single electron -- and I &apos;m going to take a sequence of the electron -- and the only one that &apos;s called the electron , and it &apos;s a very low @-@ speed , and it &apos;s a very simple , a new magnetic field .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-47.443905): so if you take this kind of a bottle of energy , you &apos;ll get this little bit of a bottle that would be used in the air .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-9.694324): how does it look like a light bulb ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-8.827263): so , this whole , a whole thing .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-83.543404): but the short sound -- if you look at this , you can see a little bit of a long time , and then you can see the same thing that &apos;s made in this room , and then you can take a little bit of energy from the universe .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-12.380772): no , India doesn &apos;t have any research .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-19.586185): so , this is a little bit of a lot of time , and I &apos;m going to show you what happens .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-70.874893): the third one of the first pieces of wood is called a piece of paper that &apos;s going to be put in a little bit of the air , and then it &apos;s going to be able to change .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-29.207279): and in a sense , you get to the bottom of the room , and you see the heat of the ground .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-24.958872): and the most expensive thing is that they put a lot of energy in the back .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-17.934660): and if you look at this , the camera is made out of the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-50.466858): and the winds are moving from the surface of the air , and the parts of the world are actually very close to the end of the video .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-60.464012): so if you take a picture of the same thing , you &apos;ll see the same thing that you &apos;ve got to do , and then you &apos;ll get a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , and then let &apos;s do something better ?
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-6.701013): a day , no one , a year .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-28.775656): this is a very difficult -- a little bit of a little bit of a rock in the middle .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-9.318661): and how much of this is a plastic experience ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-24.315891): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air , and the color of the street .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-12.254375): it &apos;s like if you put a stone in a rock .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-53.477566): I would like to tell you that this is a kind of a black hole , and it &apos;s a kind of a re@@ alist , and it &apos;s a kind of invisible object .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-47.518791): but if you look at the material , you &apos;ll see that the red line is not going to be a little bit of the blood that &apos;s coming into .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-38.554432): why is this ? and the squid is in the case , and it &apos;s a piece of paper that &apos;s coming back to us .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-58.441780): so , in the next phase , if you &apos;re in a new way , you can actually be able to get a camera in the backyard , and you can &apos;t be able to get it into the outside .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-10.273725): so what &apos;s the camera that I &apos;ve been working on ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-70.119537): so , if you look at a long time , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a long @-@ term , you can &apos;t see it in a long time , but we &apos;re going to be able to make a little bit more powerful than the first one .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-90.611710): so we &apos;re going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;m going to try to take this data and put it into a very simple , very simple , very quickly , and we &apos;ve got to see that this kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-22.538357): and we can put all this stuff on the right , and we can do this very quick thing .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-15.599000): so , the name is going to be done .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-36.263084): and how do you think that there are other creatures that could be a great new way to make a living ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.430855): the idea is that we &apos;re going to light into the ceiling .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-49.979164): it &apos;s going to be able to go back into the center , and then we have to go back to the back of the room , and the whole piece of the air .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-11.055410): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve just seen it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-10.164905): on the left , we &apos;re going to get a camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-26.109455): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to take the camera out of the window .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-39.805054): the first thing we had was called &quot; The Ori@@ gin of Spe@@ cies , &quot; and it was made by a lot of different shapes .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-129.863068): and we can take this light that &apos;s going to be able to get a little bit of the light , and then you can see that the light is going to be able to get a little bit of the wind , and then the light will be completely in@@ scri@@ bed , and then we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit more of the fil@@ tering .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-29.790722): and when we have a camera , it &apos;s a very important tool to be able to have our first camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.023087): it &apos;s a great way to do it in the world and see the same thing .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-51.555332): but the way we do it is to the point of view , because we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we &apos;re all the way to the outside of the room .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-96.305740): if we can take a camera , we can take a camera , and see the light -- and we can actually see this piece of paper -- and I &apos;m going to show you how much of the lights are , and we &apos;re able to see the same thing that we can actually see in the universe .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-2.998722): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.647393): so this is the actual app .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-127.026016): we &apos;ve seen a lot of things that we can do in the lab , and we can see the air , and we can see that we can actually go back into the air , and we can see the first step in the air , and we can see the same thing that we can see in the air , and we can actually see where we &apos;re going to do with the same thing .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-72.332169): but it &apos;s also the most important part of the technology that &apos;s been done , and this is a very important part of the technology that we &apos;re going to talk about today , is a new kind of experimental experimental technology .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-138.487000): so , as a scientist , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of science , and the science of the universe is that we can &apos;t have a whole lot of images , and we can actually see that the whole universe is made by a few seconds , and we can actually use this new technology , and then we can &apos;t see the whole collection of the universe .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-9.575674): but there &apos;s something that &apos;s really interesting .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-21.552155): if you look at these waves , you can see the waves coming from the road .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-11.156482): the things that we can go to .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.916363): what &apos;s going on ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-37.883179): and it &apos;s been that we could put a lot of light in the early universe , and I thought , pretty much of this .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-66.819107): the point is that the universe is in the world , in which you can take a lot of changes , and then we put them into the space , and then we can make a decision @-@ making .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-112.230110): so , if you can &apos;t be able to take the idea of the new space , and we &apos;ve been able to take the idea of the world , and we &apos;ve been able to do that in our own book , and we &apos;ve got to be able to give the new ideas of the last few years .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-4.270788): it &apos;s time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-5.970586): there are many ways of helping our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-29.379471): we don &apos;t have any side of the street , but we don &apos;t have to be able to do the same thing .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .
Predicted (-51.823509): and I &apos;ve been working on the Internet , and I &apos;ve got to give you some of the things that are going to be re@@ treating and re@@ treating and abuse .
Src: die Projekte entstanden aus meinen Fragen , wie , wie viel Miete zahlen meine Nachbarn ?
Ground Truth: and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
Predicted (-26.487139): the projects I started from my own , how many people would go to the street ?
Ground Truth: how can we l@@ end and borrow more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
Predicted (-16.496271): how do we need to make more money without any ?
Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-22.605858): how do we take away from the urban and create the buildings that we really feel .
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-26.135159): how do we create our lives and our own communities that are allowed to help our lives ?
Src: ich lebe in New Orleans und ich liebe New Orleans .
Ground Truth: now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans .

Ground Truth: my soul is always so@@ oth@@ ed by the giant live o@@ ak trees , sha@@ ding lovers , dr@@ unks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
Predicted (-84.981758): this is the most powerful piece of mine , and it &apos;s been made by a few years of the world , and it &apos;s a lot of my own life , and I &apos;m not going to be able to see the world .

Predicted (-33.364101): and the most interesting part of the city is that they &apos;re living in the world , and they &apos;re also a lot of the city .
Ground Truth: I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a ni@@ cer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
Predicted (-47.886723): I &apos;ve been working on this , and I &apos;ve got to do something that I &apos;ve seen , and I &apos;ve got to do this in a way that I can do it .

Ground Truth: her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
Predicted (-26.536383): she was a woman who was in her mother , and she was like she was a shock .
Ground Truth: and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
Predicted (-38.823380): but I had a lot of joy and joy , and I think that I &apos;ve been doing a lot of life , and I &apos;ve been thinking about this .
Ground Truth: but I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .

Src: es ist leicht , sich im Alltag zu verlieren und zu vergessen , was wirklich wichtig ist .
Ground Truth: I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day @-@ to @-@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
Predicted (-21.091480): it &apos;s a constant point to keep in mind , and that &apos;s important .
Ground Truth: so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board and sten@@ c@@ iled it with a fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ blank sentence : &quot; before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
Predicted (-95.433304): and with this little boy , I would take a new piece of paper , and I would say , &quot; I can take a look at the same time , and I &apos;ll be able to see that this guy was going to be a little bit of a re@@ mov@@ al in the city . &quot;
Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-35.394878): I don &apos;t know if I was in the lab , it was the same thing that you could walk around and walk through .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .

Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-16.665060): the other one is the most important thing we have to do is to change people .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-44.975422): there &apos;s a lot of time in the brain , and the more important thing to do is to be able to look at the same time , and to think about what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-50.265675): we &apos;re always talking about death , and I think it &apos;s just about the fact that we &apos;re not going to be a lot of the people who are dying in the process .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-12.301009): the conclusion of life is that we think about .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-72.397835): the challenges of our lives are about the world , and we are going to help us to create a better place , and to help people to live in our own lives , and to help ourselves more and more and more ways .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.096024): thank you .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.096024): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-41.924934): so I &apos;m a little bit more interested in the question that we &apos;re doing with is to be a social scientist , which is a key thing .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-8.096896): no , we know what it &apos;s going to do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-12.772205): so I &apos;m going to talk to you today , which is how I do it .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-10.207576): it &apos;s a tough place in the face .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-34.499584): we &apos;re in the dance of the beautiful , beautiful , friendly and ta@@ sting .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-55.082771): so , in a very powerful form , a very powerful set of traits , and it &apos;s a tremendous need to be able to do something about the individual .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-54.050037): so , in fact , the most powerful thing that I did is to take a look at the same kind of thing that he had in his life .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-12.363635): and so many of you have been working on this technology .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-78.227913): there are millions of people who are dying in the world , and yet we have a tremendous amount of disease , and yet , in the same way , the heart of disease , and we can &apos;t get a chance to do something about it .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-52.455574): so we have to do this , and we have to have a sense of the right thing , if we have a problem , it &apos;s a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-71.265366): and it &apos;s not a lot of good , but if you have a little bit of a drug that &apos;s been able to do that , you can &apos;t have a little bit of the brain that &apos;s available .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-32.197128): you can &apos;t do it , and you have to do it , and it &apos;s not just a few months ago .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-12.076154): but what if we had the patient to do with this ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-28.058237): it would be a car that would be used to be a better way of doing this .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-23.129948): it was not a hospital @-@ to @-@ be @-@ to @-@ do @-@ work .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-18.693726): it &apos;s so much to be able to do that in the U.S.
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-55.183575): so I &apos;m going to try to make sure that we &apos;re going to use this kind of thing , because we &apos;re in the right way , and I &apos;m going to be able to do anything in the last century .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-11.976471): so here &apos;s a video of the pin@@ ch .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-91.079689): and if the sound is a little bit like this , we can put a little bit of a human , and we can put it in the wrong way , because we have to take a lot of h@@ ells , and we can put them in the same way .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.492450): and as a result , it &apos;s a tremendous amount of training .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-10.494521): remember , when you learn how to live .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-44.032063): and the muscles can actually take the skin , and we can see the mal@@ ignant skin of the patient &apos;s mouth .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-30.826456): and in the middle , you can see a little bit of a single @-@ hand hand corner .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.839492): we see the same thing .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-14.648726): the cl@@ oning is the age of voice .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-38.220306): and the body is a bit more nuanced than it &apos;s a speaker , and it &apos;s a lot of mis@@ use .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-130.543381): so this can be the same , and the ability of digital printing , and that &apos;s a lot of information , but it &apos;s a lot of information that we can see in the heart , and it &apos;s a very simple example of how we can actually be born in the heart of the software that &apos;s been used today .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-38.653919): so , if you &apos;re using these tests , you can &apos;t have any better answer , but they &apos;re pretty good at the same test .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-10.341821): so , it &apos;s really the infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.413360): you don &apos;t have to build a new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-8.987067): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.628659): so you can see it .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-10.443797): they &apos;re very , very quickly , 30 seconds .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-13.012194): they &apos;re very cheap , and we &apos;re going to see what it &apos;s doing .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-17.913025): if you &apos;re a very efficient way , it &apos;s really a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-10.706917): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-13.650462): we can do this with severe risk .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-21.661354): no data can be used to test the patient &apos;s license .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-13.653895): we can move through a completely different paradigm .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.763618): we can take a long @-@ term genome , and we &apos;ve been able to study the same number of individuals that are doing .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-24.115782): so we &apos;ve been able to take the evidence for the first time to find it .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-42.234016): so we &apos;re going to take this step into the first step , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this in the first @-@ term .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-67.041687): and by the time , we have a number of children with a number of un@@ charged , and we have to do this for the first time , to make a huge amount of information .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-22.023506): we &apos;ve got a little bit of the two @-@ thirds of the planet .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-72.619484): and without any device , if you can get a little bit of a car , you can &apos;t have to be able to do it for four hours , and I &apos;ll say that we &apos;ve been able to do that .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.096024): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-34.096928): if you take the medicines , we &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , how do you get sick and you have to eat them ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.952224): what do you do with all of these little bits ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-38.221138): the problem is that when you get to the patient &apos;s brain , you know , it &apos;s not a mistake , it &apos;s a mistake .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-7.877957): you can &apos;t even think of it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-54.616646): but there &apos;s a lot of information that we &apos;re doing , and this is a very important thing to do , because these are the key things that we call , which is that we &apos;re doing .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-14.859127): now , how does it have any lower income ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-1.998516): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-78.060608): my boss , I &apos;ve been able to do this , because it &apos;s a fantastic idea that we can do it , and it &apos;s been done by the way that we &apos;ve done this in the world -- that &apos;s a tremendous amount of data .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-7.020303): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-61.950104): this is the question that you can take -- and you can send people to the doctor &apos;s office , and you can see the money that &apos;s going to be able to take the phone from the iPhone .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.438549): I &apos;m here in the country , and I &apos;m working on the south of the northeast monsoon .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.068638): and the background is the most li@@ d in the woods .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-54.404060): the Great Be@@ ar is the same thing that we can do in the south of the park , and it &apos;s a very , very easy way to do the same thing .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-20.628006): the males , the females , and they are the ones that we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-4.168544): they kill our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-43.874359): this is the morning , I was a dead accident , and I was in the morning , and it was just a lot of the dead .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-52.099251): the island of the Gulf , and the elephant , the one that we &apos;ve been looking at is that we &apos;re living with our plants and the other .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-11.563410): and as a child , I was afraid to speak .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-26.913982): the protect our mother , and they &apos;re the root of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.466628): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-15.057544): here &apos;s a man who was killed in the northern hemisphere .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-29.671104): and I think that there &apos;s a lot of conservation in the United States , and also a lot of this .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-41.115555): my mother is a man who was in the forest , and he died with me , and he was not going to feed me .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.850488): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.580025): my first idea was to kill fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-32.426910): but I realized that there was no way to help the doctors , but not to help the people out of the ground .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.446489): but I didn &apos;t go .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-19.440376): I was a second person . I thought I could do it with a sheep .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-29.021046): I thought that I would be the only dog to go out and get rid of the sheep .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-4.595777): but lions are very important .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-38.953232): you &apos;ll see the car coming in , and they &apos;re going to see the same thing , and they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-7.650964): and they fight and kill us .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.587849): I was walking in a couple of days , and I was walking through the boat , and I was able to take the wheel off the floor .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-14.744090): the elephant is afraid of moving .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.339987): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-57.909157): so , I was a little bit of a little bit of the day , and I was walking around the city , and I was able to see that I had a little bit of my life .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-49.105610): I took a three @-@ dimensional radio , a little bit of a car , and you can see it in the middle of the head , and you can &apos;t see it .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-15.239446): and I thought I had to get a signal out of the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-12.431805): this is a little girl from a hand@@ washing machine .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-5.737406): and then I built this whole .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-38.468582): this is the energy supply that we can take off the roof , and then we call it a new piece of metal .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-17.139490): and the big thing is , you know , you know ,
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-24.660320): you know , the stories are coming out of the mountains , because they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-8.806630): and this is what the queen is .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-31.698624): the color of the lights , and I &apos;m sure that the hell is going to be there .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.096024): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-28.120800): I was going to have this on the ground , and we didn &apos;t have any access to our lives .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-6.330776): and then we got to the neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.914825): one of them was my grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-23.748203): and she had no interest in her hands , and I knew how to get them in the morning .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-2.130377): and I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-22.355198): I would have the lights on the left , and you see the color of the screen .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-31.096466): I &apos;ve been working in the neighborhood , and they &apos;ve been able to do this with a lot of food .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-72.525101): this is a way to use the forest to communicate with the plants , to the other , to the wild , to the wild , to the birds , and to the other .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
Predicted (-40.834976): I was a lawyer who was working on my own school , and I was a great opportunity to help in the U.K.
Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-19.165005): my education is about helping and help them .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
