Predicted (-94.256348): now , as I &apos;ve been talking about the problem , the result of the success of the world is that it &apos;s not just a chance to be a result of what &apos;s happening in the last one , and it &apos;s not the case that it &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-19.730209): it &apos;s not our desire to teach us what is the best one .

Predicted (-28.161709): I &apos;m afraid that you &apos;re not going to get the decline of the amount of money in the United States .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-48.927757): but when I go home , I &apos;m in the school , I &apos;m going to tell you that the students are in a way , and they &apos;re going to be a part of the future .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-35.073448): and I &apos;m a good reason for the country , and I think that the rest of us have been born .

Ground Truth: I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .

Predicted (-61.956898): the first project I was working on was a new book called &quot; The Li@@ g@@ us , &quot; which is the only thing that we &apos;ve learned to do with our children in the world .

Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-79.264580): so , the amazing thing about this is that the phot@@ oc@@ oc@@ oc@@ ation of the galaxy is a very powerful part of the process , and it &apos;s a lot of the material that &apos;s been used to be able to understand .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .

Ground Truth: take your science , subtra@@ ct your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
Predicted (-94.150482): so , if you look at your own presentation , you &apos;re going to have a lot of attention , and you &apos;re going to have the idea that you &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s the most powerful thing that you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .

Ground Truth: instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under Republican or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chief magi@@ strate , titles of respect@@ ability -- not bloody President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maje@@ sty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ularity , i@@ .@@ e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
Predicted (-136.733643): and after the first time , we would say that it was not just a non @-@ governmental , and the only way to the government is to be able to do it , and in the &apos; 60s , &apos; 60s , &apos; 60s , &apos; 90s , &apos; and &apos; not only , &apos; 60s , &apos; s are not just the way to understand what &apos;s going on .
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-8.177314): you can see a lot of things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-49.159798): and I &apos;m just saying , &quot; This is the best thing I &apos;ve ever done before in the last few days , is to get the name of the law .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-36.372612): the President Obama said , &quot; No , only to get it in the &apos; 70s , and that &apos;s not the case .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-30.240784): so , if you think that you &apos;re going to have a new one , you know , it &apos;s almost impossible .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-51.126316): and the final thing is , the last thing is , is that the last thing that you &apos;re talking about is , &quot; Why don &apos;t you have to say that the country is in the United States ? &quot;
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-43.884216): so , you know , the whole thing that has been done is that we &apos;re going to have a huge amount of oil and the rest of the world .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-17.103664): and the story is , they &apos;ve made a picture of the growth .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-14.148275): and this is the only way to the crash .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-8.413651): you have a strong statement .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-36.605141): and the other side of the community , the more you know , the more it &apos;s been , and it &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-14.145381): but how do you know , a lot of Americans have ever been there ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-3.201778): AB : seven .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-32.571304): because you &apos;re just going to be wondering , &quot; Well , the little bit of the mouse .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-59.659321): and the only thing that the president is in the &apos; 50s , and then the only one is that the United States has no choice , but it &apos;s not going to be in the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-14.852202): and the problem is , and I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m doing with you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-51.036530): so , we can understand how to change the minds of reality , and even more words are changing in the world , but it &apos;s a much more profound than the reality .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.196372): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .

Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-63.986824): I was a little bit of a di@@ re @-@ j@@ ab , and I had a little bit of the wind that I could put in the back of the building .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.584901): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-340.115570): and I was very good at the time , and when I was working with a lot of people , we were able to go to the South Bronx and see a lot of pro@@ pen@@ sity for the world , and we were able to do this , and we were talking about the same kind of &quot; B@@ our@@ f &quot; and &quot; and &quot; Con@@ c@@ ession &quot; and &quot; Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ci@@ te &quot; in the &quot; in the &quot; with &quot; with &quot; in the &quot; and &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; in the most of the &quot; in the &quot; and &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; and &quot; and &quot; with &quot; and &quot; and &quot; with &quot; with &quot; and &quot; with a lot of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of

Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-7.222761): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-66.485268): so I &apos;m here , and the United States is a non @-@ governmental organization , and the only one of the most famous , and the former government in the United States has been working on it .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-134.702011): so I &apos;m not interested in this , but in a way , the world is a lot of ways that you can do with the idea of making it invisible and un@@ realistic and un@@ realistic and un@@ realistic and that you can &apos;t get to the world , and it &apos;s going to be able to make a sense of the way that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-116.943253): I &apos;d like to take a book of &quot; The Inter@@ state , &quot; and &quot; The great thing is to be a man @-@ based , &quot; with the power of the world , &quot; and &quot; Ex@@ c@@ tiveness , &quot; or &quot; Li@@ c@@ or &quot; Li@@ th@@ in@@ i .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-41.937397): and what if the leader of the country is a business leader , and I asked him , &quot; What is the best way to do ? &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-41.304581): and this is what they call to use to make the aid of the company , to make it more accessible .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-139.899200): I &apos;m going to talk about the U.S. government , and we &apos;re going to go to the United States , and you &apos;re going to try to get a look at the way that the police are not going to work with the police and the police , and they &apos;re not going to use it in a way that is a good way of looking for the people who are going to go out of the world .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-30.700382): I wonder what the conflict would be like in the &apos; 90s is , &quot; What is the case of a conflict ? &quot;
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-163.879166): and the people who are in the &apos; 60s , and the only way to create a new way of building a city , and it &apos;s a non @-@ lethal re@@ alist , and it &apos;s a way to use the local and the traditional ar@@ mies to create a new state of the city , and it &apos;s not a kind of a re@@ mor@@ se of a re@@ alist .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-117.948120): and I would like to give you a look at the &quot; The O@@ th@@ th of the E@@ c@@ re @-@ opt &quot; in the world , and it &apos;s a very important way to bring the power of the world to be able to get rid of their own in@@ spe@@ ction from the United States .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-38.168694): but in those things , you can get to that kind of un@@ contacted people , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-22.002142): but I &apos;m always trying to understand because it &apos;s the only way to change the Bible .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-9.085828): this is my own . what is that ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.020558): thank you .

Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-21.382992): Hi . my name is , and I &apos;m a lot of the time I &apos;m talking about .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-11.567428): so , for 10 years , it &apos;s all right .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-45.254486): so I think this is a way that I &apos;ve been working with this room , and that &apos;s not going to have any kind of a chair .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-11.391648): I &apos;m a little bit more interested in this .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-28.590469): so this is the first time that I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a TED Talk , and you can see it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-53.265972): so , in a few years , I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;ve been doing this , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s just get some of these words . &quot;
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-35.250095): I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m going to show you a few things , because I &apos;m going to see that in the last two minutes .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-8.118013): and it doesn &apos;t have any chance .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-25.996624): so , the very good thing is , it &apos;s not too good to be there .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-58.246304): the only thing I &apos;m going to do is to go to the bed , and you &apos;re not going to do anything else , but I &apos;m going to say , &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to do that . &quot;
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.933314): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.899798): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-2.278138): that was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-13.354046): well , I didn &apos;t think that this was an image .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-17.735577): a bit of a metaphor , but it &apos;s a very powerful picture .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-19.948536): I &apos;m sure that all of you have in my mind , this is completely different .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-12.137206): and in this case , I didn &apos;t know anything about my own .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-27.380758): and I was very afraid of my father , and I was looking for the people in my pocket .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-76.612656): and by the way , the men and the other hand , I think , &quot; We have a lot of time , and I think it &apos;s not just about the same way that we can do something that is in a very simple way . &quot;
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-16.704826): and being too honest , for me , is to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-16.964294): and I &apos;m standing here in front of a book , because I &apos;m a journalist .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-29.454350): I &apos;m in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , and I &apos;m a hero who is a hero .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-19.605740): now I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be done on the other hand .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-9.470592): the first question is , &quot; What do you do in a dictionary ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-19.199987): I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not saying that , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what it is .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-58.486340): the most important thing I &apos;m going to call is a global , and it &apos;s a kind of a professional model , and that &apos;s a good way to be able to get it from it .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-109.916565): now , in the last few years , we &apos;re not very strong and very strong , and we &apos;re just looking at the beauty of the universe , and it &apos;s a very strong , and it &apos;s a kind of a natural , and it &apos;s not a matter of a living , and it &apos;s called &quot; tem@@ plates . &quot;
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-22.625305): I was a legacy for this project , and it &apos;s been a tool for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-74.411728): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s going to look at the same , and you know , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to have a lot of pro@@ p .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-16.360020): and finally , I think , you know , the whole thing is very simple .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-99.700996): but I &apos;m going to show you that the biggest one in the world has been done with a number of studies , and it &apos;s not a single one @-@ year @-@ old , and it &apos;s not just a single one that has been done in the world , and it &apos;s all the way that you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-21.606655): the next thing I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to be a digital revolution ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-18.806740): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really want to be the right part of my law . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-16.207935): so the other thing I want to say is , &quot; Well , what are I really going to do ? &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.229806): you know , you can do anything .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-64.733185): you know , if you &apos;re going to be the biggest race race , or the American dream of the C@@ es@@ ar , or the next one , you know , &quot; This is not the same thing . &quot;
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-45.434616): and when you get to this , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; Well , if you &apos;re a lawyer , I &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-37.068298): I don &apos;t want to be the only one @-@ year @-@ old or @-@ old or @-@ old , and I &apos;m going to say , &quot; The World Cup . &quot;
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-52.243156): so , you know , if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the word , you &apos;re going to be able to get the pi@@ vot@@ al of the bomb .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-20.408066): you can &apos;t believe it &apos;s not the fault and it &apos;s not an incredible thing .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-34.816502): I &apos;m going to show you a lot of data that &apos;s going to be able to use the same technology as a result .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-143.800110): and if you see that there &apos;s a camera , and the camera is going to be a little bit of the head , and the guy , and he &apos;s going to go back , and you can see , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s see , &quot; and then you &apos;re going to go back , &quot; and you &apos;re not going to see the same guy , &quot; and the next time , &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .

Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-12.603095): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-3.517265): I didn &apos;t know what happened .
Predicted (-83.600098): and when you get a lot of money , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of money , and you &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re going to have to do this in the &apos; 80s , and you &apos;re not going to have a good word , &quot; This is not going to be a good word . &quot;
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-12.292541): the next question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Is this ever possible ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-24.851746): so , of course , you can see , and it &apos;s just a few minutes of the whole thing .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .

Predicted (-66.858727): and you have to see the first ones that are made in the air , and the most beautiful thing that they &apos;ve been doing is they &apos;re all the same , and the most beautiful ones that are alive .
Ground Truth: so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;

Ground Truth: but mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a legacy of gender and racial oppres@@ sion when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fici@@ aries .
Predicted (-42.105831): it was a very difficult way to deal with the rise of the American , and I think it &apos;s a very powerful connection to our country .
Ground Truth: but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
Predicted (-107.850494): I &apos;m sure I &apos;m not going to work in the last few years , and I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m going to have a good career , and I &apos;m going to have to be able to do it , and I &apos;m not going to have a chance to be able to do that , and I &apos;ve got a chance of seeing what &apos;s going on . &quot;
Ground Truth: if there &apos;s a tak@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowle@@ dging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Predicted (-48.995415): and if you &apos;re going to take this out of a little bit of a message , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with all of our own mistakes .

Predicted (-1.215522): it &apos;s extraordinary .
Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-41.231014): well , there was no doubt that I could have been in the experience of my life , and I remember that I &apos;ve been able to tell you how many of them were .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-66.016266): but I have to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve been thinking about , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s not about the ability of compassion . &quot;
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-37.906033): so the perception of the region is that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s a different way of thinking about it .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-12.185616): it &apos;s just one way to say , there &apos;s a lot of other things .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-46.534130): and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; Well , if you &apos;re a teenager , you can &apos;t be able to do it and I &apos;m just going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-6.427115): you &apos;re really inspiring .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-66.042290): and if we &apos;re not the only one , you know , the only one that &apos;s true -- and we &apos;re all born , and that &apos;s a gift of the gift of the human spirit .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-23.239489): so , in the end of life , we &apos;re going to change the way we &apos;re doing something .
Src: bitte - sagen Sie mir nicht , dass ich normal bin .
Ground Truth: please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .

Ground Truth: Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet p@@ ier@@ cing through an apple , and exposure just a million@@ th of a second .
Predicted (-93.037277): he was doing a film with a pro@@ p , and he was able to take a picture of a complete de@@ par@@ ture and a complete piece of the skull , and then we &apos;ve got a picture of the entire genome .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-44.039093): but we &apos;re going to die , and in a decade , the next time , you &apos;re going to see a million or a billion of them are not a single one .

Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-58.201473): I &apos;m going to show you a series of tools that are using in a new way of making the world &apos;s work , and it &apos;s a very , very exciting way to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-48.199238): and we can put out the camera on the back of the screen , and we can see that in our own way , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on in the sky ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-123.480270): and I &apos;m going to take a picture of a mouse , and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of a mouse , and it &apos;s a very simple , very simple , very simple , and that &apos;s the same , and that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to be able to measure the speed of the universe , and then we &apos;re going to be able to use it .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-46.746571): so , if you take this picture , you can put a little bit of the air@@ bag into the bottle , and then it would be in those extra dimensions .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-6.262986): how about a light bulb ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-5.896404): so , this whole , of course .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-76.047913): so , you know , it &apos;s a little bit like this , but if you &apos;re going to take a picture of the Earth , you can see that , you can take a little bit of time , and then you &apos;re going to have a little bit of time in the universe .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .

Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-18.032976): so , in this case , this is a lot of fun , and I &apos;m going to show you what happens .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-59.929005): so , the first example of this is that when you put a piece of paper , it &apos;s going to be put into the atmosphere , and then we &apos;re making it a little bit of the back .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-26.776978): and in a sense , you have to look at the bottom of the room and see the waves .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-37.191025): and the most effective way of doing this is to get a few minutes and put it in the back .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-17.752518): and if you look at this , there &apos;s a camera that &apos;s made in the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-58.191628): so , the flow of the air is in the middle of the room , and you &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s a lot of these pieces of the tunnel .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-63.526321): so if you take a picture of the C@@ C@@ E , you can see the same thing , and then you have to do something that &apos;s going to take the last 10 years , and then we &apos;ll have to do it .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-6.212961): one day , no , a week .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-34.617424): it &apos;s a very nice , very simple , very difficult , to go into a series of things .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-13.673904): and how much of it is to live with a plastic experience ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-25.888721): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air , and the color of the street .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-16.633398): it &apos;s like if you &apos;re in a rock , you have a rock .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-56.316448): I mean , the way that the viewer would be a picture of a human , and it &apos;s a kind of a shadow that &apos;s not as an object .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-61.662163): but if you look at the fact that you &apos;re seeing that the red line is that they &apos;re not going to be completely alive , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the plastic .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-40.473415): why is it ? and this is the case that the first one is in the back of the box , and it &apos;s just a few minutes .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-66.576317): so , in the lab , if you &apos;re in a remote fashion , you can actually get a light that &apos;s going to be able to get a camera in the middle of the room , and you can &apos;t even see anything .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-15.664133): so , what &apos;s my team doing is I got to show this ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-76.664894): so , as you &apos;re looking at a few years ago , you &apos;re going to see a little bit of a little bit of a car , and you &apos;re not going to have a big , but you &apos;re going to have a long time @-@ term view of the universe .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-91.573395): so we &apos;re going to take this , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of a piece of paper , and we &apos;re going to try to figure out what I &apos;ve done with this , and we &apos;re going to have a little bit of the data that we &apos;ve done in this case , and we &apos;re going to use it .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-23.261919): and we can put all these things in a pretty good way , and we &apos;re going to do this .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-7.911504): so , you can see ,
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-33.617542): how can you be able to make a new , but if you could have a new kind of imagination ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.152519): the idea is that we &apos;re going to light into the sky .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-49.272713): it &apos;s going to be coming back , and we &apos;re going to go back to the center of the room , and that &apos;s where the camera is going to be made .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-13.759353): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve got it all .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.711246): on the left , we &apos;re going to be a camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-31.844233): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to be able to put the light on the back .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-43.376999): and the first thing we had was done was , &quot; The Institute of Natural History , &quot; and it was made in a series of different ways .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-129.894974): and we &apos;re going to be able to put these light @-@ made @-@ down @-@ the @-@ shelf , and then you &apos;re going to be able to see that the light will be made in a little bit of a light that &apos;s going to be able to get back and down , and then we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of the light that &apos;s going to be made .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-31.594666): and when we &apos;re working on this machine , it &apos;s a really big camera that has to be the first four @-@ dimensional .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-23.205803): it &apos;s a great way to make it look at the world and see it in the same way .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-54.932739): but the way we &apos;re looking at the distance , and the fact that we don &apos;t know anything about the object , but that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to be able to do .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-132.310120): and if we can take a camera , we can see a camera , and we can see the light that &apos;s going on , and we can see that , and we &apos;re going to see the same thing , and we &apos;re going to see that , in fact , in the same way , we &apos;re going to see the same thing , and we &apos;re going to see that light @-@ up .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-2.554210): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.948580): so this is the actual prototype .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-127.826447): we &apos;ve been able to see that we &apos;re going to see in the air , and we &apos;re able to see the actual actual process of building the air , and we &apos;re able to see that we &apos;re going to see in the back of the air , and we &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to see the next few days , and we &apos;re going to see the way we &apos;re going to see in the future .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-76.283211): but it &apos;s also the most important part of the research , and this is a little bit more important than the technology that I &apos;m going to talk about , is that the first step of the technology is actually a computer scientist in the field .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-122.442902): so , as a scientist , a lot of science , and I &apos;m going to show you that we &apos;re using , and we &apos;re able to see that , in the last few years , the idea of a complete 3D printer , and that &apos;s a complete complete , and we &apos;re going to have a whole lot of information that we &apos;re seeing in the universe .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .

Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-12.449452): and the way we could move .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-1.389917): what happens ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-43.479660): so , we realized that there was a lot of light in the universe , and we had a pretty strange , very surprising way of seeing this .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-60.553837): the point in the universe is that , in the world , you know , in the same way , we &apos;re going to be able to make a sense of the motion and the user @-@ generated information .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-132.704498): so , in a way , we &apos;re going to be able to use our ideas and re@@ fres@@ hing the idea of the world , and we &apos;re going to have to be able to use the idea that we &apos;re going to have to be able to take the data and re@@ fres@@ hed , and we &apos;re not going to have a new set of ideas that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .

Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-6.918757): there are many ways of changing our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-30.872259): we don &apos;t have any party on the road , but we don &apos;t have to be able to look at the same time .

Ground Truth: so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board and sten@@ c@@ iled it with a fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ blank sentence : &quot; before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
Predicted (-108.899429): and with the idea of a new day , I was able to make a new book , and I would say , &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to take a look at the work of the world , and I &apos;m going to be able to see that this guy would be a little bit more comfortable in the back of the room . &quot;
Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-46.656754): I don &apos;t know what was happening in the &apos; 60s , and I was able to look at the whole room , and it was just a little bit of the time .

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Predicted (-12.871444): &quot; well , I want to be able to do anything . &quot;
Ground Truth: so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
Predicted (-57.885147): and in this case , the family was a place that was made for me to be the most painful and the joy of the people and the dreams of the day .
Src: es geht darum zu wissen , dass man nicht allein ist .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
Predicted (-8.684031): it &apos;s about knowing that you don &apos;t .
Src: es geht darum , unsere Nachbarn zu verstehen und zwar auf eine neue und auf@@ schluss@@ reiche Art und Weise .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enli@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
Predicted (-28.239361): it &apos;s about us to go and make a difference , and it &apos;s a very different way of thinking .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
Predicted (-34.878941): it &apos;s about the way we think about it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do for us .
Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-96.951134): I &apos;ve got a few years ago , and I &apos;ve got this idea that all the people in the world have been working on a wall , and I &apos;ve got to go back to the South Bronx and we &apos;ve got a bunch of these books , and we &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s a lot of people in the West .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-45.209366): we have a lot of the way we &apos;ve got to do our knowledge and our own decisions , and we have to share the rest of the world .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-23.836216): the other one is the most important things we have in the world , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-36.543789): in a way , there &apos;s a lot of time to look at the complexity of the brain , and it &apos;s very important to understand what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-42.730980): we &apos;re just talking about death , and I &apos;m going to talk about the fact that we &apos;re not talking about the fact that we &apos;re doing a lot of pain .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-11.747817): the conclusion of life is that we think about .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-68.330505): the main thing about the world is that we &apos;re going to help us to make our lives more and more creative and more creative , and to help us , and to think about ourselves , and to help us live .

Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.050464): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-37.501663): so I &apos;m working with a mathematical model , which is a good deal with the answer , because it &apos;s a common problem .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-8.140181): no , we know what it &apos;s going to do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-20.829163): so I &apos;m going to try to do that , because I &apos;m going to try to do this .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-7.442201): it &apos;s a curious thing .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-37.479942): we &apos;re very comfortable with the ti@@ dy @-@ gurdy -- and we &apos;re just looking at the beautiful ones .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-54.590496): so , in a sense , a common component , a common sense , a tremendous skill , and that has been a unique way to understand .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-54.063133): so , in fact , the most powerful way of doing this is that it &apos;s been a little bit of a living animal that I &apos;ve been working on for him .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-10.468735): and so many of you have been working on this technology .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-84.883377): there are so many people who have been working on this planet , and they have a huge impact on the planet , and they have a lot of damage , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do something about the disease , and that &apos;s the same thing that we can do .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-62.376759): we have to do it again , and we have to do the right thing , and if we can understand that there &apos;s a problem that &apos;s going to be able to do it in a way that &apos;s not possible .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-75.303322): so , you know , there &apos;s no good brain , and there &apos;s no such thing that you can do , and that &apos;s a lot of a few of these studies , and you can &apos;t have a test of the brain .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-41.117672): you can &apos;t do it , and you &apos;ve got to do it , and it &apos;s not a product that &apos;s done , and it &apos;s very interesting .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-6.976156): but what would you do with the patient ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-29.221874): I would like to get a car in the &apos; 70s , and if you could do that , what would you do ?
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-14.952529): it was not a device that could be done .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-27.483770): it &apos;s like a $ 20,000 , and it &apos;s going to be able to use the research .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-83.361992): so I want to use this to be a simple way to think about it , because we &apos;re in the right way , and I &apos;m going to use all of this , in fact , in the way , in the past , we &apos;re not going to be able to do that .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-10.532696): so here &apos;s a video of the screen .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-88.948471): and the animal is a little bit like this , because if we have a good word , we can put it in the mouth , we can put it in the back , and we can see that there &apos;s a lot of respect to the human brain .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.110865): and by using it , it &apos;s a very powerful way .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-19.963116): think about how long it &apos;s done , you know , you know , you know ,
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-61.003471): and you can see the hand of the mouth , and the only way that the rat can be used to be the same as the skin of the body .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-23.900187): in the middle , you can see that there &apos;s a very low @-@ frequency range .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.825061): we see the same symptoms .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-17.455931): the cl@@ oning is or the bl@@ ending .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-32.864529): and the body is a bit of a professional , and it &apos;s a lot of mis@@ use .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-150.702332): so this is that all of these neural networks , and in fact , that you can see , in a sense , that the brain is actually a lot of information , and it &apos;s a lot of information that we &apos;ve been able to do , and that &apos;s not just a few years ago , but it &apos;s not just a professional , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of the same .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-30.894716): so , you can see , in the same way , they &apos;re not quite quite good at the clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-12.133121): so , of course , it &apos;s really a lot .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-12.364143): you have no new way to build it .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-8.706487): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-11.502788): so you can see , they &apos;re going to be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-8.958836): they &apos;re very , very quickly , 30 seconds .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-10.876926): we &apos;re very cheap and you know what it &apos;s called .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-20.620949): and if you &apos;re really smart , it &apos;s actually a lot of cost @-@ effective .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-10.230289): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-11.554995): we can also do a lot of harm .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-17.047646): no one has to do the tests in the lab .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-16.961426): we can start to see a completely different paradigm .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-45.990871): we have a very successful , and we &apos;ve developed a recent study of the genome that &apos;s going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-22.650669): so we &apos;ve been able to do the evidence for the first time to get rid of it .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-27.773447): so we &apos;re going to do this in the first time , we &apos;re going to take a piece of the equation .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-63.643623): and by giving up a video , we have a number of un@@ contacted numbers , and we have to be able to use the same number of people to get the same .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-29.695000): we &apos;re making a small , and the number of people on this planet are one of these things .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-76.757072): with a friend , or a friend , you can &apos;t have enough , and we have to say , &quot; I &apos;ve got a few minutes to get rid of the same as we &apos;ve been able to do with that . &quot;
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.050464): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-24.845093): when you go to the clinic , you know , we &apos;re going to kill them , and what are you going to do ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-11.198345): what do you do with all of these little boxes ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-34.563614): what happens is that when the patient is to take a look at the patient &apos;s disease , it &apos;s not a mistake .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-7.288568): you can &apos;t even think of it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-58.025013): but we have a lot of information , and this is a very important thing , because we &apos;re looking at these kinds of things that are made in terms of what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?

Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.014101): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-62.669022): my colleagues , I &apos;ve been working on this , and I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; This is a fantastic idea that it &apos;s done in the world , and it &apos;s been done by using this technology . &quot;
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-5.920718): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-84.444923): so , you can see the guy who &apos;s going to use the phone , and you can ask the phone to make the money , and then you can ask the question of how to do this , and you can get a copy of the phone .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-10.476778): I &apos;m here in the middle of Brazil .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.040518): and the flowers in the &apos; 60s are the equivalent of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-43.136154): the Great Be@@ ar is a very small , and it &apos;s the same way that we &apos;re going to do in the wild .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-18.467144): the males , the males , and they &apos;re the ones that they &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-6.995045): they &apos;re killing our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-41.820545): this is the day I was in the morning , and it was a dead accident , and I was pretty sure that it was all about the time .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-52.664703): the elephant , the elephant , and I think , the elephant , and the roots of our species are living with us , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-12.090445): as a child , I was too scared to speak .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-28.593760): the neighbors are calling us the cause of death , and they &apos;re part of the wild .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.833652): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-17.643461): here &apos;s a man who was in the middle of six .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-17.462284): and I think that the ocean is also a lot of competition .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-28.789904): my mother is a man in the United States , and he was so fortunate to go for six months .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.845019): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-12.939087): my first was fear of being a man .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-31.065048): but I realized that the only way to help us get rid of the street , and not to help us .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-3.265085): but I didn &apos;t go .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-15.398124): I was a problem . I asked myself to make a mistake .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-26.987795): I wanted to say that I was the only way to the wild horse .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-4.528485): but lions are very .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-43.712200): you see , they &apos;re going to go back and watch the boat , and they &apos;re going to look at the same time . and you &apos;re not going to see that .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-6.941723): and they stop and fight .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.595806): I was in the morning , and I was walking through a boat , and I was able to put the boat in the back of the boat .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-10.107837): the lions are moving .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.303671): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-72.442268): so , I was working on a little bit of a little bit of the day , and I was doing it , and I was able to see that I was making a lot of money , and I was going to see it .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-50.246254): I took a three @-@ dimensional camera , and you can see a light bulb , and you can see it from the bottom , and you can &apos;t see it .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-17.267490): and I thought I had to go back and get some of the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-12.816352): this is a little box of a hand@@ bag .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .

Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-41.763512): so the solar system has to go through the energy , and we can use a tri@@ m of the X @-@ ray .

Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-18.555454): and the big thing is , you know , it &apos;s a little bit .

Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .

Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-77.571465): so , in my own way , it &apos;s a way to do the wild , and also to the wild , to the wild , and to the wild , is to be able to look at all kinds of animals .

Predicted (-25.849773): so , I &apos;m going to be a tech engineer , and I &apos;m sure that &apos;s the most exciting thing .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-48.288818): I was in the midst of the war , and I &apos;m going to try to kill the elephants , and I can &apos;t see the secrets of our hearts .

Ground Truth: so these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
Predicted (-31.733976): these are a lot of times , and it &apos;s a way to be a little bit more than a moment .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Predicted (-54.704346): we &apos;re not in a way that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re going to spend a few hours of time in the past , and we &apos;re not going to be able to change the past .
