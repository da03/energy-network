Src: was Afghanistan angeht , so habe ich etwas erkannt , das im Westen oftmals ab@@ getan wird : hinter den meisten von uns , die Erfolg haben , steht ein Vater , der den Wert seiner Tochter erkennt und dem bewusst ist , dass ihr Erfolg auch sein Erfolg ist .
Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-69.717651): now , the question is , when I talk about the last thing that &apos;s done is , in fact , the best thing that we &apos;ve never seen is that the success of their own success is a result .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-24.224699): that &apos;s not what our mothers do , not to be the key part of our lives .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-51.925056): they &apos;re also very often in the case of the people who are in the case of the United States , and they &apos;re not a good part of their society .
Ground Truth: under the Taliban , girls who went to school num@@ bered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
Predicted (-28.655975): and the few months later , they were not there , but the only one in Africa .

Predicted (-27.167404): I &apos;m afraid that the amount of money is not going to be put in the air .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-59.173107): but when I go home , I &apos;m in the school , I &apos;m going to be able to see the kids who are in a very different way , and they &apos;re going to be a part of the research .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-38.514977): and I &apos;m a good reason for the country , and I have to say that the rest of us have been born .

Src: ich war verzweifelt .

Ground Truth: so we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tom@@ atoes and zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini and ...
Predicted (-86.358704): we were in the middle of this country , and we were able to take a look at the local village , and we called the &quot; B@@ ha@@ il &quot; -- from the south to the south of the country .
Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
Predicted (-39.676277): and the military didn &apos;t really make sure that they were all the time , and they were doing it , and they were doing it .
Src: wir waren erstaunt , dass es in einem so frucht@@ baren Tal keine Landwirtschaft gab .
Ground Truth: and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fer@@ tile valley , would not have any agriculture .

Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
Predicted (-18.625525): I mean , to open up the door , there &apos;s a great freedom .
Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-22.490665): we &apos;re not really interested in the invention of the world , and we &apos;re going to bring to the Internet .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-68.544861): the problems that we &apos;re working with today is that we &apos;re not going to talk about , and I think , and it &apos;s a lot of problems , and we &apos;re not going to be able to understand how we &apos;re going to do it in a way .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-33.030708): but this is a lot of people who don &apos;t believe us , and our engineers are going to be in the war .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-17.529831): so , scientists , engineers , and they &apos;re not going to be there .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-38.430260): I want to show you some of the things that we can do , and you can see that technology is made out of the way that we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-17.338520): the first question you have to ask is , &quot; Well , you know , is it true .
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-24.942944): and it &apos;s a very clear point that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-66.720924): and it &apos;s not that they say that we &apos;re not going to be able to understand what &apos;s happening in the form of bone , but we &apos;re also going to be able to understand that they &apos;re actually a little bit more complex .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-22.369259): and what you do is that they &apos;re going to kill your own symptoms .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-21.617439): and the cognitive surplus is a little bit of what you want to do .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-47.638493): you know , &quot; Well , you can &apos;t have any sense of what &apos;s going on , but it &apos;s not going to be a little bit of time , and what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-18.696247): you &apos;re not going to make your sense of what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-25.462055): and the writer said , &quot; Well , how hard things can do is not just that way . &quot;
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-30.921219): you can &apos;t see a lot of what &apos;s going on , and you can &apos;t get to this work .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-38.744148): and so , some of them are very important to see in the world , and we &apos;re going to give you some examples of what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .

Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-45.975677): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to be a person who &apos;s going to do with this , and I &apos;m going to take a little bit of a little bit of that .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-47.671955): and this is not just a little bit of the case , but it &apos;s also a little bit of the way that we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-63.926659): and the great example of this is that the phot@@ oc@@ oc@@ oc@@ ri@@ ty of the galaxy is a very important process , because it &apos;s a lot of material that &apos;s made by the way .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-98.258278): this is a piece of paper that &apos;s just a piece of paper that &apos;s going to be able to understand , and the only way we can see in the world is to understand how it &apos;s going to be , because it &apos;s a lot of the way that we &apos;re using .

Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-34.084782): if you think that the government is going to be a little bit more successful , then you &apos;ll never have a failure .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-41.362076): and the final thing is that the most important thing is , is , in fact , the last thing that we &apos;re not going to say , &quot; Is this country ? &quot;
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-45.407997): and that &apos;s the most expensive thing that we have to do with the world , and the billions of dollars is going to be a nuclear waste .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-16.287510): and the story is , of course , the shape has been made .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-13.695857): and this is the only way to the crash .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-7.344811): they have a great deal .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-25.776348): and the other side of the community , the more you know , the one I &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.240912): but how do you know that a single president ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-4.448313): AB : 14 .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-30.934681): because you &apos;re just going to be the guy who &apos;s going to get out of the air .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-52.219742): and the first thing that he &apos;s lost is that every single one in the United States is not going to be a lawyer , but it &apos;s the case of the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-17.721916): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with me , and I &apos;m going to take you through it .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-35.053764): try to understand the words of reality , but the reality of the world is not just going to be more complex than any other story .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.491237): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-78.984825): so I went to a little bit of a year @-@ old , and we went to the United States , and it was a very good @-@ looking , very serious , very serious , very serious example .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-73.934372): I was a little bit of a b@@ ou@@ ro@@ l , and I had a little bit of the crash , and I would never see that it was going to be able to put a hole in the back .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.463562): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-157.155853): and I had a lot of time , and we were working with a lot of men in the &apos; 60s , and I was able to go to the same country , and we had a little bit of the same , and we would call it &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; and &quot; a good deal with &quot; Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ us &quot; .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-6.177541): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-56.944214): so I &apos;m here , the only one in the United States , the former Soviet Union , and the former Soviet Union , and a non @-@ governmental organization , which is a non @-@ governmental organization .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-100.671181): but I &apos;m a lot of people who are interested in trying to make sense of how to make it invisible and not to the world , but I think it &apos;s a wonderful way to bring the power to the world , and to make them feel very powerful and to make it more beautiful .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-98.475731): I &apos;d like to take a new day from the American community , and the whole thing that has been done with a non @-@ governmental , a non @-@ governmental , and it &apos;s called &quot; Li@@ th@@ u@@ c@@ c@@ ing@@ us . &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-62.632217): and if the government is going to be a business party , and I said , &quot; What do you want to do with this , I &apos;m going to take a job , &quot; and I &apos;m not going to do this ? &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-42.898827): and this is what they call to use to create the government , to make them more accessible than the most vulnerable .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-121.537231): I &apos;m going to talk about the U.S. government , and we &apos;re going to try to get a look at the money in the U.S. , and you &apos;re not going to be able to get rid of the local police and the police , and the police , and the other one in the room , and they &apos;re not going to do with the same kind of a better way .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-36.329796): I think that the question I &apos;d like to go to the public in the &apos; 70s is a particularly unusual case .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-132.624008): and the people who are in the &apos; 60s , and the only way to do is to create a new kind of a local park , a local local park , a non @-@ governmental , a non @-@ governmental , and we could use the art of the city with an open @-@ source and @-@ ended mon@@ ot@@ op@@ op@@ to@@ id .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-126.005829): and I would like to give you a little bit of the M@@ .D. , which is the case of the most beautiful , in@@ scri@@ bed in the world , to be able to take away from the National Museum of Modern Art in which he was able to do with their own de@@ par@@ ted and to bring them back to the country .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-31.594238): but in those things , you can get to that , you know , you &apos;re going to be able to get rid of them .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-14.586051): but I do it because I believe it &apos;s the only way to change .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-12.898886): that &apos;s my own . what is your demand ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.020488): thank you .

Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-26.656586): David is my name . and I &apos;m sure that &apos;s where I &apos;m much more about the time .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-9.638241): so , for 10 years , they did .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-39.647125): so I think this is a little bit of a room that would have been put into my own backyard , and I don &apos;t have any money .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-11.436572): and I was a little bit more involved .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-31.712252): this is the first time I can tell you , a moment where you &apos;re going to be able to hear something about it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-34.078285): and many of them were so successful that I didn &apos;t even think this is what I &apos;d like to do in the morning .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-27.634644): I think it &apos;s very clear that I can put in a few minutes , because I think that &apos;s going on .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-7.967027): and it &apos;s not the chance .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-18.867430): and the good thing is that they &apos;re not too good at them .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-56.355782): the only thing that &apos;s going to be in my head is to get you to touch , because I &apos;m not going to do anything else , but you &apos;re going to get away .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.225497): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.867200): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-8.162470): that was a very embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-16.447178): so , I didn &apos;t think of this as an early age .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-19.305914): a matter is a complicated , but it &apos;s a very powerful view .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-15.925212): I &apos;m sure that all of you have been in my head .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-16.683369): and this is a moment where I didn &apos;t even know any of my friends .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-36.628746): and I was very afraid to go to my father and see me in the same way that I was sitting with my hands .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-71.819778): and as the men and the rest of the room , I think , there &apos;s no more important things that we can do in the process , and I think it &apos;s a very simple way to be able to do something about it .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-18.418156): and to be honest , I &apos;m too happy to be in this .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-12.719607): and I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , because I &apos;m a scientist .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-29.615387): I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , because I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s a hero .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-28.016853): I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be done , but I &apos;m going to ask people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-8.576001): the first question is , &quot; What do you do in a dictionary ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-10.487035): I said , &quot; Well , I think , that &apos;s not true . &quot;
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-50.067684): the most important question is , if you &apos;re a lawyer , I think , you can actually be a very efficient product , and I think it &apos;s a very important question .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-56.867485): now , in the last few years , we &apos;re not just a wonderful thing , and we &apos;re very interested in the beauty of the brain , and it &apos;s a very strong form of survival .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-17.499523): and this is an architect , and it &apos;s worth me with it .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-71.694374): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , I think , &quot; -- there &apos;s a lot of mis@@ sil@@ h , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit of a mess .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-16.347847): and the first thing I do is you know , very simple .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-126.528900): but I &apos;m sure that the project has been working on is a single @-@ scale scale , and it &apos;s not a single one that &apos;s been done by the time , and the only one that has been done with the four percent of the most expensive , and it &apos;s not a single one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-29.182198): the next question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m a single one , will I be able to do it ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.349709): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t believe that I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-14.909521): so the other part of the question is , &quot; Well , I want to give you a little bit of that ? &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.469869): you know what ? you can do .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-55.629635): you can see the American dream of the U.S. , or the C@@ es@@ ar , or the next one , which is , &quot; You know , I &apos;m not going to be a big deal . &quot;
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-46.878078): and then , when you get to the top of this , I said , &quot; No , no , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , no , I &apos;m going to be a lawyer . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-47.843937): I don &apos;t want to be the best or the best selling product in the United States , and I &apos;m a little bit of a political advis@@ er .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-45.518826): and you &apos;ll say that if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the wrong thing , you &apos;re going to be able to get the word .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-16.941250): you can &apos;t believe it &apos;s not the failure and it &apos;s an incredible opportunity .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-27.178410): I &apos;m going to show you a new record of your brain , because it &apos;s just as much as possible .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-140.805679): and if you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a piece of paper , and he &apos;s sitting here , and he &apos;s going to be able to see the first one , and he &apos;s going to go back to the back , and he &apos;s going to be able to see the same thing , and then the next one , and the next one , and the first one is , &quot; The time , &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-2.399656): it looks like this .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-14.100224): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-5.331655): I didn &apos;t know what this is .
Predicted (-87.287704): and if you have a lot of money , you &apos;ll get a job , and you &apos;ll never see that if you &apos;re going to do this , you &apos;re going to be a good word , because you &apos;re not going to have an iPhone , you &apos;re going to have a good word in the &apos; 70s .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-12.694126): the question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Is this ever possible ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-26.766281): but the photos are just pretty much , and it &apos;s just a little bit of the original one .

Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-43.812828): this is the first piece that I did , and I was a little bit of the film that I had ever seen before , because it was a pretty old man .

Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-88.564079): it &apos;s the kind of software that we &apos;ve been working on and the world , and they &apos;re not using the name of the rock , and I &apos;m a writer , and I &apos;m just a guy who &apos;s in the audience , and they &apos;re all familiar with them .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-16.854038): now , the other people say , &quot; Is it going to be good for me ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-60.003155): I have a few hundred or six , I &apos;m not going to be there , but I &apos;m going to have some sort of stuff that I &apos;m going to do , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .

Predicted (-43.879608): and that &apos;s all the time , because it &apos;s not the only thing I &apos;ve seen before , because I &apos;m told you , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you how to do this ? &quot;

Ground Truth: but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
Predicted (-86.195320): I &apos;m sure I can &apos;t know how many years of being done , and I &apos;ve been here , and I &apos;ve been able to say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got a chance to be able to do this , and I &apos;ve never seen it for a few years , or 10 years before . &quot;

Ground Truth: I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migr@@ ants .
Predicted (-72.645050): I wanted to tell you that this was a very difficult story , because I couldn &apos;t even go to the south , and it was a very difficult country , but it &apos;s also a very clear case of how to grow in Asia .
Ground Truth: so I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be re@@ patri@@ ated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
Predicted (-49.226707): but I was feeling a strong reaction to the soul , and I felt that it was a bit more likely to be in the middle of my life .

Ground Truth: these North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky .
Predicted (-15.368630): and the authorities were not quite a lot of this .
Ground Truth: every year , countless North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ patri@@ ated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Predicted (-42.659882): and in the United States , they &apos;re going to be killed by 17@@ ,000 people , and they &apos;re going to be arrested .
Ground Truth: even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
Predicted (-32.939651): and for me , I was too much too late in the West , because of many other Islam .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s tragic that North Kore@@ ans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .

Ground Truth: even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
Predicted (-31.726067): and as they &apos;ve been able to find a new story , it &apos;s made in the world that they can do .
Ground Truth: that &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Predicted (-37.707100): so , after the year I was working on a new way , I decided to go back to college , and I started to do this .

Predicted (-29.315693): in fact , a million people have been trying to hold their own position .

Ground Truth: the kind stranger symboli@@ zed new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Predicted (-104.035240): and the only way to help the public , the more he was told to be the family of the city , and the mayor of the country , and the more he was told to be able to help him to support the local community .
Ground Truth: eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ united in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Predicted (-37.711014): so , after the first time , I was in my family , and I decided to be able to create a very clear part of the country .

Predicted (-30.387791): the teachers who are working on the education of the community , and also help us learn from education .
Ground Truth: we can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
Predicted (-78.976013): so we can see the difference between the communities and the United States , and we can actually move to the street , and we can &apos;t even get it back to the family , and to give them a sense of the rest of the world .
Ground Truth: I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give asp@@ iring North Kore@@ ans a chance to pros@@ per with international support .

Ground Truth: when he sin@@ gs songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Predicted (-60.825012): when I play a film , I &apos;m not talking about his own , it &apos;s a little bit more like this , and he &apos;s not thinking about how much he &apos;s going to be .
Ground Truth: Samuel is 16 . he &apos;s tall . he &apos;s very handsome .

Src: doch viele Leute stimmen nicht zu .
Ground Truth: but most people don &apos;t agree .
Predicted (-5.554472): but many people don &apos;t agree .
Ground Truth: and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and misunderstood .
Predicted (-36.253315): because , in fact , you can &apos;t see the difference in their own way , and they &apos;re not really going to be more honest .
Ground Truth: but what lifted my heart and strength@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
Predicted (-71.221489): but the identity of the country was so important , because it was the case that I had never seen before , and it was a very important thing , as it was , in fact , that it was a very different sense .
Ground Truth: now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
Predicted (-62.359264): now , for example , the most important thing about this is that we &apos;re not talking about social networks , but the language of the brain is a form of creativity , and it &apos;s a very complex memory .
Ground Truth: it manifest@@ s in each individual differently , hence why Rem@@ i is so different from Sam .
Predicted (-27.110439): it &apos;s also a different way of being treated , and it &apos;s like this .

Predicted (-55.306419): he had his friends and his life , and he had a lot of money , and he was working on the side of the world , and he was able to make a difference between them .
Ground Truth: and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Predicted (-12.679688): and as he was born , it was more and more complex .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Predicted (-86.944099): but the thing that he did was to take the idea of the world and the mon@@ ot@@ ings of a war , and a man who never had a good life , and no one had a different sense of being .
Ground Truth: extraordinary .
Predicted (-1.137032): it &apos;s extraordinary .
Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-34.296959): well , there &apos;s no doubt that I could have been in the experience of my life , and I remember how many of them were coming back .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-54.665199): but I want to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Well , trust , trust , trust , and that &apos;s not about anything . &quot;
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-42.851269): so the perception of the brain is that we can &apos;t see a lot of other people , and it &apos;s not a matter of what we think .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-13.570456): it &apos;s just one way to say that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-36.961910): and I &apos;d like to be able to get a word , and I would say , &quot; Well , if you &apos;re too smart , you can &apos;t do it .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-4.526532): you can be extraordinary .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-54.879696): because , if you &apos;re not a hero , we &apos;re all born , and we &apos;re all part of the story -- that &apos;s a gift of happiness , a gift .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .

Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-56.741001): I &apos;m going to show you a series of new tools that are now building a series of new materials that are actually made in the world , and it &apos;s a very difficult way to do .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-51.111687): and we can take the camera on the back of the screen , and we can see our own picture of the lights , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on in your own room ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-139.591019): so if I can take a picture of a magnetic field , I &apos;m going to take a little bit of a single electron -- and I &apos;m going to show you that the electron is a completely different sequence , and the only one @-@ dimensional , a @-@ half @-@ dimensional , a @-@ dimensional , a @-@ dimensional , and a half @-@ dimensional , and that &apos;s what it is .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-47.207710): so if you take this kind of a bottle of energy , you &apos;ll get this little bit of a bottle that would be used in the air .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-9.458530): how does it look like a light bulb ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-8.596796): so , this whole , a whole thing .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-66.858528): but the short sound -- if you look at this , you can see a little bit of energy -- that &apos;s the same thing that you &apos;ve made in this room , and you can take a couple of years into the universe .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .

Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-19.820747): so , this is a little bit of what I &apos;m going to show you , and this is what happens .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-46.914646): the third one of these reactors , which is a piece of paper that &apos;s made in the air , and then we put it into a little bit of the surface .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-29.069412): and in a sense , you get to the bottom of the room , and you see the heat of the ground .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-26.876650): and the most expensive thing is that they put a lot of light in the back and forth .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-17.462238): and if you look at this , the camera is made out of the water .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-50.271088): and the winds are moving from the surface of the air , and the parts of the world are actually very close to the end of the video .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-60.429291): so if you take a picture of the C@@ C@@ enti@@ l , you &apos;ll see that the same thing that you &apos;ve got to do is take a 10 @-@ year period , and then you &apos;ll get to the same time .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-6.666814): a day , no one , a year .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-29.006744): this is a very difficult -- a little bit of a little bit of a rock in the middle .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-8.727868): and how much of this is a plastic experience ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-23.920277): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air , and the color of the street .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-11.984411): it &apos;s like if you put a stone in a rock .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-53.480900): I would like to tell you that this is a kind of a black hole , and it &apos;s a kind of a re@@ alist , and it &apos;s a kind of invisible object .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-47.058922): but if you look at the material , you &apos;ll see that the red line is not going to be a little bit of the blood that &apos;s coming into .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-37.832199): why is this ? and the squid is in the case , and it &apos;s a piece of paper that &apos;s coming back to us .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-65.320335): so , in the next phase , if you &apos;re in a new way , you can actually be able to get a camera in the backyard , and you can &apos;t be able to see anything that &apos;s going to be a living .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-12.904004): so what &apos;s the camera that I got to do with my first project ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-69.953392): so , if you look at a long time , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a long @-@ term , you can &apos;t see it in a long time , but we &apos;re going to be able to make a little bit more powerful than the first one .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-84.639481): so we &apos;re going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;m going to try to make this tiny , tiny , tiny , tiny , tiny , realistic and then we &apos;ve got to do this .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-22.440647): and we can put all this stuff on the right , and we can do this very quick thing .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-16.031414): so , the name is going to be four .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-46.162441): are the other things that can be a great way to make a new , but if you could be able to create a new hip ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.189398): the idea is that we &apos;re going to light into the ceiling .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-49.935791): it &apos;s going to be able to go back into the center , and then we have to go back to the back of the room , and the whole piece of the air .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-10.784122): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve just seen it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.900418): on the left , we &apos;re going to get a camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-26.130186): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to take the camera out of the window .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-39.621368): the first thing we had was called &quot; The Ori@@ gin of Spe@@ cies , &quot; and it was made by a lot of different shapes .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-138.051178): and we can take this light that &apos;s going to be able to get a light @-@ made , and then we &apos;ll get to the back of the box , and then you can see that the light is going to be a little bit more open , and then the only one that &apos;s going to be able to get a little bit of the wind that &apos;s going to be made in the same time .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-29.739632): and when we have a camera , it &apos;s a very important tool to be able to have our first camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.055775): it &apos;s a great way to do it in the world and see the same thing .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-41.336327): but the way we get to the point of view is that we don &apos;t know anything about the outside of the room , but it &apos;s a little bit of the object .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-103.593330): if we can take a camera , we can take a camera , and see the light -- and we can actually see this piece of paper -- and I &apos;m going to show you how much of the objects that we can see in the universe , and we can actually see that they &apos;re going to be able to do this stuff .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-2.981556): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-4.619251): so this is the principal .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-124.046509): we &apos;ve seen a lot of things that we can do in the lab , and we can see that we can actually go back into the air , and we can see the first step in the air , and we can see the air , and we can see the same thing that we can see in the air , and we can actually see where we &apos;re going to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-71.260612): but it &apos;s also the most important part of the technology that &apos;s been done , and I &apos;m going to be able to talk about this technology , because the first one is a little bit more sophisticated than the first one in the field .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-134.552460): so , as a scientist , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of science , and the science of the universe is that we can &apos;t just take a few seconds , and then we can see that all of the new technology , and the whole collection of images , the technology that we &apos;ve seen in the world , and we &apos;ve got to do with this .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-9.463060): but there &apos;s something that &apos;s really interesting .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-33.648399): if you look at these waves , you can see the waves coming from the road , they &apos;re not going to see .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-11.159972): the things that we can go to .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.813544): what &apos;s going on ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-37.248547): and it &apos;s been that we could put a lot of light in the early universe , and I thought , pretty much of this .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-67.958694): the point is that the universe is in the world , in which you can take a lot of time , and then we put them into the space , and you can make a sense of the user .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-109.248528): so , if it &apos;s not a new way of making our ideas , and we &apos;re going to be able to take the data from the back of the world , and we &apos;ve been able to do this , to be able to read the last few years , to have some idea of the ideas that we &apos;ve been able to do .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-4.083006): it &apos;s time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-5.765544): there are many ways of helping our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-31.670525): we don &apos;t have any side of the street , but we don &apos;t have to be able to spend the same time on the road .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .

Predicted (-44.607422): there &apos;s a lot of time in the brain , and the more important thing to do is to be able to look at the same time , and to think about what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-50.218826): we &apos;re always talking about death , and I think it &apos;s just about the fact that we &apos;re not going to be a lot of the reasons for the death of the war .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-11.872212): the conclusion of life is that we think about .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-73.596848): the challenges of our lives are about the world , and we are also going to help us to create a better place , and to help people to live in our lives , and to help ourselves more and more and more ways .

Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.068043): thank you .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.068043): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-41.888958): so I &apos;m a little bit more interested in the question that we &apos;re doing with is to be a social scientist , which is a key thing .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-7.921107): no , we know what it &apos;s going to do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-12.411914): so I &apos;m going to talk to you today , which is how I do it .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-7.761672): it &apos;s a tough place .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-34.103714): we &apos;re in the dance of the beautiful , beautiful , friendly and ta@@ sting .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-54.524406): so , in a very powerful form , a very powerful set of traits , and it &apos;s a tremendous need to be able to do something about the individual .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-55.012966): so , in fact , the most powerful thing that I did was to take a look at the same kind of thing that he had in his life .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-15.047482): and the number of years has been working on a lot of problems .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-88.083336): there are millions of people who are dying in the world , and yet we have a tremendous amount of disease , and yet , in fact , that we can do something that &apos;s going to be lost , and we can &apos;t have a long term of the human brain .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-53.530823): so we have to do this , and we have to have a sense of the right thing , if we have a chance to do it , it &apos;s a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-71.483383): and it &apos;s not a lot of good , but if you have a little bit of a drug that &apos;s been able to do that , you can &apos;t have a little bit of the brain that &apos;s available .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-30.559217): you can &apos;t do it , and it &apos;s a little bit better , and it &apos;s not going to be done before .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-10.886185): but what if the patient was able to do with this ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-41.969334): it would be a car that would be used to take a look @-@ like @-@ the @-@ day situation , and if you could do that .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-22.959000): it was not a hospital @-@ to @-@ be @-@ to @-@ do @-@ work .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-24.080620): it &apos;s so much to be able to take the program in the United States .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-58.184994): so I &apos;m going to try to make sure that we &apos;re going to use this kind of thing , because we &apos;re in the right way , in the last few cases , is to be able to do anything .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-11.637337): so here &apos;s a video of the pin@@ ch .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-98.319984): and if the sound is a little bit like this , we can put a little bit of control , and we can put it in the wrong way , because we have to have a lot of different kinds of facial expressions , and we can give them the same de@@ par@@ able .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.519816): and by doing it , it &apos;s a very efficient way .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-10.416905): remember , when you learn how to live .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-43.523132): and the muscles can actually take the skin , and we can see the mal@@ ignant skin of the patient &apos;s mouth .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-27.955048): in the middle , you can see a little bit of a single @-@ hand hand corner .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.886281): we see the same thing .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-16.899696): the cl@@ oning is born , or the skill .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-29.774673): and the body is a bit of the ear , and it &apos;s a lot of mis@@ use .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-111.509575): so this can be the same information that can be used in software , and it &apos;s a lot of information , and it &apos;s a lot of basic improvement , but in fact , that we can actually have a new memory of the brain , and that &apos;s where we can &apos;t see it .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-38.479767): so , if you &apos;re using these tests , you can &apos;t have any better answer , but they &apos;re pretty good at the same test .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-10.262228): so , of course , it &apos;s really green .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.297047): you don &apos;t have to build a new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-8.901768): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-10.114922): so you can see it all over .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-9.955633): they &apos;re very , very quickly , 30 seconds .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-12.817430): they &apos;re very cheap , and we &apos;re going to see what it &apos;s doing .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-18.592772): if you &apos;re a really efficient way , it &apos;s really a lot of things .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-10.696148): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-13.317889): we can do this with severe risk .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-21.830502): no data can be used to test the patient &apos;s license .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-16.430550): we can do a completely different paradigm by measuring .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.146858): we can take a long @-@ term genome , and we &apos;ve been able to study the same number of individuals that are doing .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-42.242638): so we &apos;ve been able to find the first time to get rid of the disease , which is , in fact , is it a lot of them .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-34.747517): so , we &apos;re going to take this step into the first step of the game , which is called &quot; N@@ ile . &quot;
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-65.902809): and by the time , we have a number of children with a number of un@@ charged , and we have to do this for the first time , to make a huge amount of information .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-25.363201): we &apos;ve got a little bit of the planet , which are two billion people .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-68.759155): and without any device , if you can get a little bit of a car , you can &apos;t have to do it , and I &apos;ll be able to get a few minutes from the last six months .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.068043): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-33.858418): if you take the medicines , we &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , how do you get sick and you have to eat them ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-11.038643): what do you do with all of these little bits ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-37.913147): the problem is that when you get to the patient &apos;s brain , you know , it &apos;s not a mistake , it &apos;s a mistake .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-7.758703): you can &apos;t even think of it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-60.881634): but there &apos;s a lot of information that we &apos;re doing , and this is a very important thing , because we &apos;re going to do , in fact , that these are the key factors that are made out of our own behavior .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-13.908178): now , how does it have a 40 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-1.929926): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-67.847542): my boss , I &apos;ve been able to do this , because it &apos;s a fantastic idea that we can do it all over the world -- and it &apos;s been done by the way that we &apos;ve done this in the world .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-7.138159): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-63.017159): this is the question that you can take -- and you can send people to the doctor &apos;s office , and you can see the money that they can use to make their own child &apos;s license .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-3.777825): and it &apos;s exactly .
Src: vielen Dank . Max Little , meine Damen und Herren !
Ground Truth: thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .

Ground Truth: thanks , Tom .
Predicted (-0.414779): thank you .
Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.239759): I &apos;m here in the country , and I &apos;m working on the south of the northeast Amazon .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.139067): and the background is the most li@@ d in the woods .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-46.213467): the Great Be@@ ar is a very small , and the most important thing that we can do is to put the forest in the woods .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-20.419806): the males , the females , and they are the ones that we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-3.953712): they kill our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-32.222382): this is the morning , I was in the morning , and it was a dead accident . it was all the time .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-47.825409): the island of the Gulf , and I think that our species is a little bit of the trees , and we have to go from the other .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-11.490461): and as a child , I was afraid to hate them .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-26.430635): the protect our mother , and they &apos;re the root of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.513838): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-16.187744): here &apos;s a man who was killed in the 5@@ th .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-22.546806): and I think that there &apos;s a lot of conservation in the United States , even though .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-35.255314): my mother is a man in the morning , and he died with me , and he was still on my farm .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.623669): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.461697): my first idea was to kill fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-31.614437): but I realized that there was no way to help the doctors , but not to help the people out of the ground .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.273242): but I didn &apos;t go .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-20.279255): one thing I did was I was trying to take a look at a human .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-28.860397): I thought that I would be the only dog to go out and get rid of the sheep .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-4.337833): but lions are very important .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-38.602577): you &apos;ll see the car coming in , and they &apos;re going to see the same thing , and they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-7.507714): and they fight and kill us .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.488972): I was walking in a couple of days , and I was walking through the boat , and I was able to take the wheel off the floor .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-13.612169): lions are so hard to see the light .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.250355): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-55.513222): so , I was a little bit of a little kid , and I was still working on the other day , and I found that I had a lot of light from my life .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-38.237202): I took a three @-@ dimensional radio , a little bit of a car , and you can see it in the right way .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-15.109813): and I thought I had to get a signal out of the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-12.210896): this is a little girl from a hand@@ washing machine .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-5.558490): and then I built this whole thing .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-37.943935): this is the energy supply that we can take off the roof , and then we call it a new piece of metal .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-16.632637): and the big thing is , you know , you know ,
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-26.450577): they think the stories are coming out of the river , because they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-8.632610): and this is what the queen is .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-31.382507): the color of the lights , and I &apos;m sure that the hell is going to be there .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.068043): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-24.924658): I was going to have this on the ground , and we didn &apos;t have any access to it .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-6.232565): and then we got to the neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.741023): one of them was my grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-23.122326): and she had no interest in her hands , and I knew how to get them in the morning .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.982221): and I said , &quot; Yeah .
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-22.241167): I would have the lights on the left , and you see the color of the screen .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-42.506851): I &apos;ve been working in the neighborhood , and it &apos;s been used to be a lot of food , and you can &apos;t do it .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-64.711533): this is a way to use the forest to communicate with the plants , to the other , to the wild , to the birds , to eat their own vegetables .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
Predicted (-40.691105): and I was a great job to help my graduate school from the University of California , and I was also a great deal .
Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-18.810104): my education is about helping and help them .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-44.302364): I have to come home with my friends and see if we &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;ve got to go out there , and we can &apos;t see any of them .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-45.102184): and a few months ago , I was walking in the forest of a man who was flying to my father , and I said , &quot; I &apos;ll never see anything else . &quot;
Src: und hier stehe ich nun .
Ground Truth: and here I am today .

Ground Truth: I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
