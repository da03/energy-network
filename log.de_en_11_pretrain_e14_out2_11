Ground Truth: and I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
Predicted (-64.566353): and as you can see , they are in the middle of my parents , and they are also in the past , and they are also not as good as a result .
Ground Truth: like Ahmed . that &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .

Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-73.640190): what I &apos;ve learned about is that in Afghanistan , the end of the day is that , as a result , is that the leader is a very , very honest , and they &apos;re not going to have an interest in their own interest .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-23.210928): that means that not the leader should be doing good in our work .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-78.640762): they often are the same , and in fact , in fact , one of the reasons that our parents are in the country are not in the community , and they are in a way of engaging in the conversation .
Ground Truth: under the Taliban , girls who went to school num@@ bered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
Predicted (-20.603472): only a few girls were in the hospital , because there was no fish .

Predicted (-34.381977): I think that the fear of the problem is that the majority of the water will go back and forth .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-57.768875): because when I &apos;m in school , I &apos;m in school , I can teach them how to take care of the community , and then they can help me go back to the under@@ side of the school .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-39.917633): Afghanistan is a place where the peace of the community and the day , and I hope to take them all over the day .

Predicted (-92.341751): in 2003 , we were in a very nice village called the Ar@@ du@@ i , and we found that there &apos;s a local food supply in the South Bronx , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing with the local in@@ gra@@ ves .
Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Predicted (-65.681335): in 18@@ 92 , it was about four years ago , and the New York Times had been able to do this in the &apos; 60s , because it was not a place where the world was coming out of the day .
Ground Truth: why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .

Ground Truth: Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .

Predicted (-3.400565): I had a fear .
Ground Truth: really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
Predicted (-41.484993): remember , the big deal of my parents , with these big problems , and with their friends , and they were not really big .
Ground Truth: but as these conversations un@@ folded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
Predicted (-71.142372): and when the talks started to be , they found out that there was a really awkward way to go back to the city , and then they were looking at a really tiny ,
Ground Truth: that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
Predicted (-48.813210): I was always looking at my work , and I was talking about the people who had really excited about this , and I had to tell them that the public was the same thing .
Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
Predicted (-12.056252): I think that open door to open our equipment .
Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-15.701518): we have a tremendous passion for scientists to understand the world .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-69.150139): and our most powerful technologies are in our health , and we don &apos;t know how to deal with the power of technology , and when we talk about it , we don &apos;t know what it is , and it &apos;s about the fact that we &apos;re in trouble .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-27.586794): but the amazing thing is that our colleagues are not going to happen to us when we &apos;re in the British government .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-11.194667): and scientists , engineers , designers , are doing it .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-54.481724): let me show you a little bit of this , and I can tell you that the technology is going to be able to do it , and that &apos;s how we can start to study the creativity of the way .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-16.315838): the first question that we have is , &quot; Well , how do you get it ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-17.034233): now , you know , this is a fundamental basis for what &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-83.291016): they don &apos;t tell us that the I@@ I@@ I@@ I@@ dr@@ is is , because they &apos;re going to be able to understand how they &apos;re going to be , and they &apos;re actually de@@ forming a lot of these neuro@@ modul@@ ators .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-18.873249): and if you do that , you &apos;ll make it a mis@@ conception .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-14.707232): there &apos;s a key statement in the mind .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-43.563320): now , &quot; You know , &quot; Why don &apos;t you spend time and time in the room , but it &apos;s not what it means for us . &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-20.085909): you don &apos;t understand what the concept is to be able to do .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-19.810749): Einstein said that the way is doing it , and it &apos;s not possible .
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-31.553490): you can tell us that a lot of aid in the world is not necessarily a certain amount of legislation .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-31.446785): some of these things are important to say : let &apos;s go to the stories and show them the kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-18.559864): and if you have your work , you can get the credit .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-11.808685): now you have to ask yourself , &quot; Why is it ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-40.204018): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a conversation , and then you &apos;re going to get your hand .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-35.565838): so , this is not a little bit like this , but it &apos;s actually a very close @-@ to @-@ up connection .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-86.677429): so , the Di@@ on@@ on@@ on@@ ian aspect is that it &apos;s very important to see the fact that the museum is a very common source of the structure that we &apos;ve been able to do with the original re@@ cess .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-109.266708): one is the only one that &apos;s the only way that I can use is to use the computer , and it &apos;s a little bit more about the fact that the viewer can use it to do with the fact that it &apos;s going to be able to do with the most amazing and to keep it up .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-27.962225): so , some of us are just trying to open up the door , and that &apos;s what the engineers can see in the world .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
Predicted (-45.991833): the engineers have taught me that I have a 3D printer , and I can make sure that every one is what I &apos;m going to do with a positive loop .

Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-40.958820): because they &apos;re all like the sound of a giant , or the guy who &apos;s going to be on .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-63.180439): and the rest of the house was so clear that the president is not going to be married , because the majority of you have said , &quot; You know , the one is going to be a child .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-11.577431): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do , and I &apos;ll leave you with you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-44.676350): the ideas are to use the reality , not only to change the reality , and the reality is to change the same words .

Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.081701): thank you very much .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-63.939980): so I went to a farm with a very , very late @-@ day girl named Joseph Bur@@ n@@ as@@ i , who was in the winter of the Soviet Union .

Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-58.382824): I was wearing a three @-@ pound s@@ uns@@ ol@@ ar and a half @-@ hour fire@@ flies , and I couldn &apos;t even get the pressure on the ground .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-2.724472): that was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-167.124130): after that , I was still a long time for the last two years , and I was talking about the old @-@ fashioned , private , private and private @-@ American , and the @-@ world @-@ old girl who had been able to take care of the food and the wa@@ y@@ ings of the peace and the water , and then we had to go to the back of the world .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-6.581652): but that &apos;s the self @-@ preservation .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-65.202057): so here I &apos;m not a Muslim , the West of the United States , the Yu@@ gosla@@ via , the founder of the 19th century , and a community that was working with peace .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-116.608765): now , there &apos;s no good work in this , and I can teach you about the most beautiful , beautiful , difficult @-@ to @-@ find @-@ art , and to @-@ create the @-@ world , to @-@ making @-@ go @-@ out @-@ to @-@ the @-@ art , and to @-@ law enforcement , and to @-@ making it happen .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-78.189346): I want to live a day in a new country , a man named George Bush , who are fighting the de@@ code of violence and mis@@ sil@@ ently in@@ gi@@ ous and in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-52.767792): and what the translator can do is do to make a &quot; Korean &quot; -- and I &apos;m going to do a campaign with the president of the country .
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-38.161640): and to try to do this , to create the company that &apos;s not about the bur@@ gl@@ ings of the Taliban .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-144.033157): I &apos;m going to talk about the problem in the U.S. , and the government is not going to give you a sense of taking care of the streets of the country , and they &apos;re going to give them a sign of the paper , and they &apos;re going to be able to take a look at the under@@ side of the street , and they &apos;re going to be able to give up with the money .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-26.614468): I think that in my opinion , the conflict of Afghanistan is going to be a post @-@ conflict .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-158.302155): the rab@@ bi , and the one that has been used to do with a new kind of self @-@ assembly , and it &apos;s made for us to re@@ connect with a single @-@ term , a @-@ art , and it &apos;s a re@@ cu@@ sto@@ dy @-@ of @-@ one @-@ day , a @-@ old , a @-@ old @-@ fashioned , a @-@ to @-@ the @-@ art community .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-140.509125): and I &apos;d like to see that there &apos;s a little bit of a &quot; The New Yorker &quot; actually , &quot; We &apos;re going to take a look at the fact that the co@@ ver@@ sa@@ tional &quot; -- the way that the co@@ ver@@ sa@@ tional co@@ tions of the world are able to take out of a piece of food and to make it out of the war .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-26.375267): but for all of these things , you can go into the un@@ know@@ able , you can do it .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-11.258039): but I do it because I have to respect the self .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?

Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .

Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-3.673073): 10 years ago ,
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-57.291672): I mean , this is a sense of being in a room that I &apos;ve made up a little bit of a hand@@ led , because I don &apos;t have to put it in .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-12.049040): fortunately , I have a little bit of what &apos;s going to do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-28.341730): this is the first time that you get to the TED Talk , and I think you &apos;re all going to be happy .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-43.064308): and I &apos;m sure that there &apos;s a lot of people who have been doing it , and I don &apos;t want to tell you that the first time .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-39.824432): I &apos;m actually sure that in a very difficult period , because I think it &apos;s going to be able to make something that &apos;s going to be about 10 minutes .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-7.441150): no one has to do that .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-28.388611): the number of things are very , very uncomfortable , because I don &apos;t know they &apos;re supposed to do .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-48.085915): the key part is that I &apos;m going to do something like this , because I &apos;m not going to tell you about your head , and then you &apos;re all going to do .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.419717): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-1.894441): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-2.562359): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-14.337435): now , I was not sure that this was like a moment .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-11.356524): a symbol is something that &apos;s remarkable .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-15.864855): I &apos;ve been able to remember all this time in three seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-9.301999): and on this stage , I had no idea .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-31.822430): I was very proud of my dad , and I was trying to put up the helmet and put it in my face .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-91.688637): and instead of the cl@@ ut@@ ching of the paper , there &apos;s no one that &apos;s about to be the only thing that we &apos;ve been doing in our life , and it &apos;s a little bit of time , and it &apos;s a very hard time to do that .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-10.251122): he &apos;s too scary to be .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-8.964772): and I stand up here in this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-28.567196): I &apos;m on the right side of this , because I &apos;m a young girl , and I &apos;m a guy in the kitchen .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-27.902931): I &apos;m going to ask the question that people are now , and I think , the more people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.751267): the first question is , how do you do ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-11.967427): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been saying that .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-39.755447): the reason I think the public is that a brand is a kind of a nonprofit , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-89.403969): now , most of us have been in the deep universe , and we &apos;re not very good at finding a very , very , very , very gentle and ancient , and so it &apos;s called &quot; eu@@ th@@ th@@ ri@@ stic , &quot;
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-20.297802): and this is a legacy for me , and it &apos;s a part of the honor .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-64.186523): there &apos;s a very good audience . I think that &apos;s the one that &apos;s known to be , like , &quot; R@@ ace , &quot; and &quot; A@@ w@@ ri@@ m . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-15.111556): and then I want to show you an incredible operation .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-105.933426): but I &apos;ve shown you that in the first four @-@ year @-@ old , a student who was working on the left of the A@@ .D. and the most sophisticated , and the only one that &apos;s known to be able to do that , but it &apos;s not only about five or four times .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-16.943668): the next question is , &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , how can I do that ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.866555): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know that there &apos;s no responsibility . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-17.324158): but the second one I want to do is , &quot; Why are we going to have some girls ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.110891): you know what ? you can .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-67.294075): you can have the U.S. or the American citizen , and the person in the morning is a complete mis@@ conception of &quot; C@@ enti@@ ful , &quot; and I &apos;m going to have a good idea .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-38.622578): and when you &apos;re running the big , they &apos;re not going to say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not a master . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-50.544888): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , but it &apos;s not the most important thing to be called the M@@ .D. / D , the American officer .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-24.640770): so , a game that says , &quot; You should have to do something like that .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-13.975013): it can &apos;t be understood and it &apos;s not that wonderful .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-29.122820): now , I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s a very different concept of control .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-136.721283): there &apos;s a little man who &apos;s in the middle of the watch , and then we can see that the robot is just going to give you a little bit of a moment , and then the old one , and then the only thing that goes back to the back of the mountain , and then it &apos;s going to be , and then you can see , &quot; Let &apos;s go back to the back . &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-5.417502): it &apos;s about that .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-8.544215): sometimes this is a little bit more like that .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-10.793388): I was like , &quot; Well , that &apos;s not what happened .
Predicted (-83.397896): the school has a little bit more , and I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not going to go to school , and if you &apos;re in a few months , it &apos;s not going to be a business that says , &quot; You know , you &apos;ll be in the middle of the U.S. &quot;
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-15.115760): so the question that I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-33.185600): but now , these are probably all the little things that are born , but it &apos;s just a little bit more .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-53.275646): this is the first one that I did . I was actually a photograph that I had , and I was at the end of the night , and he was actually a little bit more productive .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
Predicted (-12.685657): I know that &apos;s true , but I &apos;m a very lucky person .
Ground Truth: this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
Predicted (-14.403364): so I just saw a few weeks ago , which was all about my grandmother .

Predicted (-9.834482): and I hope you &apos;ll see these pictures , not all of us .
Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-63.198914): there are groups of artists , and they are the kind of open @-@ source , and the tools of the audience are all about the people who are in the museum , and they &apos;re not listening .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-18.614096): now , the next thing you ask , &quot; How do you get all of them ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-48.651649): yes , I have a few of them in the no@@ zz@@ les , but I don &apos;t know how to make the most fun stuff , and I can &apos;t do it .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
Predicted (-27.891594): I went to a school in Chicago , and I got a good day , and I got to buy all the clothes .
Ground Truth: when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
Predicted (-81.282043): when I was a friend of mine , I was a very bad car , and I got a press , and I got a very excited , and we &apos;d never go back to the hospital , and we got to go .
Ground Truth: and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
Predicted (-55.073074): I have no idea of how many men are , because they &apos;re not paying attention to the most people , and they &apos;re not going to get a good part of the family .
Ground Truth: I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
Predicted (-54.523857): I live in New York , and the most high @-@ income people in the South , and they were killed by the late 1980s and the majority of the time .
Ground Truth: and there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-38.341354): it &apos;s about 12 @-@ year @-@ old New York , and the only thing that I find is that there &apos;s no way to ask about ?
Src: sondern : &quot; wie oft werde ich angehalten ? wann werde ich angehalten ? &quot;
Ground Truth: but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-5.699628): but how often do I go ? &quot;
Ground Truth: when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
Predicted (-63.552673): and I learned that my research on this talk about the fact that when the U.S. did have three @-@ year @-@ old women , they can &apos;t get their income and get rid of them .
Src: die letzte Frage an mich lautet : &quot; wie ist es , ein Model zu sein ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
Predicted (-7.097032): the final question is , &quot; How about that ?
Ground Truth: and I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ nier and you have sh@@ in@@ ier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
Predicted (-38.042885): and I think you &apos;ll think that if you &apos;re a little more likely , they &apos;re going to have a positive and a female .

Predicted (-98.951302): and the other part of my proposal was to help help the local community , the most vulnerable community , the British community , the more vulnerable to the South Bronx , and the British Council , and the more people who were trying to do .

Src: doch viele Leute stimmen nicht zu .
Ground Truth: but most people don &apos;t agree .
Predicted (-5.303800): but many people don &apos;t think .
Ground Truth: and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and misunderstood .
Predicted (-47.058998): because of course , the language of the brain is not going to be involved in a very , very often , more and more importantly .
Ground Truth: but what lifted my heart and strength@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
Predicted (-54.112991): but my father , the only thing that I did was that , despite the fact that their own ancestors were born , and it was not only a very difficult thing to do .
Ground Truth: now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
Predicted (-55.132660): for example , this is not the one that &apos;s known to me , the language of autism is the same , and it &apos;s a very complex relationship with the skills that we &apos;re learning about .
Ground Truth: it manifest@@ s in each individual differently , hence why Rem@@ i is so different from Sam .
Predicted (-27.309698): each other is about the person , and it &apos;s very different to the extent .

Predicted (-13.989397): and as he was older , he was going to be more and more different .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Predicted (-85.605965): but the lead to the face of the face of the tsunami , and the music that I had never been doing , and a very , very hard thing to do is to have a child who has no access to the world .
Ground Truth: extraordinary .
Predicted (-0.222741): extraordinary .
Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-36.881992): now , I can &apos;t find a sense of the only moments of my life , which I can give you the moments of my experience .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-73.888802): but I started to talk about the idea of all the things that I have to do , and I think that music is to be in@@ cur@@ able , and they &apos;re all about to be able to make it more .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-28.076736): beauty is the same , and we can tell ourselves that there is no matter of what we &apos;re doing .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .

Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-6.658833): you can be quite extraordinary .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-48.459644): but whether there are no , there &apos;s no one , and we are grateful for the first time , and we have a unique gift to the human being .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-27.667732): the progress in the moment , and it &apos;s a change in the way that we want to do .

Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-74.646828): so we can take the camera to see the space of our eyes , and we can actually go back to the wall , and see what &apos;s called &quot; C@@ F@@ ish , &quot; because we can actually take a look at our eyes .
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-116.572472): and I &apos;ll give you an example of a single electron in the back of the stream , and that &apos;s a little bit more than a thousand , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit of a multi @-@ dimensional space , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the next two @-@ hour , and that &apos;s the speed of light .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-47.168751): so , if you take this piece of tape , and you put the balloon into the ice , you can get the balls in the bottle .

Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-2.993522): so , this whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-74.898392): so , of course , this is a concept of the speed of the Earth , but it &apos;s a little bit more than the speed of the screen , and then you can see that the speed of the screen is going to be able to do it .

Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-28.467836): and it &apos;s a part of the water that &apos;s coming up to the table , and you see the waves .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-29.603275): the most surprising thing is that the neuron has come up with a radically different footprint .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-13.883725): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that goes through the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-72.906418): the walls are coming up , and the point is that the flow of the ceiling is all in the way that they &apos;re in , and they &apos;re all held by a few of the shots .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-70.569534): so if you take a quick video , and we have the same thing that we &apos;re looking at at at at the time , and you can see the average one of the 10 @-@ year @-@ old things that we &apos;ve ever seen before .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-5.868151): a week , a day , no ?
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-17.204086): this is a very boring -- a little bit of a human being .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-15.675531): and what about this is a life @-@ lapse experience ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-37.371090): you can see the rivers , and the background , the noise in the park , the walls and the background .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-11.155655): it &apos;s like a rock in a balloon .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-51.740025): and I thought that it was like this , because it &apos;s just a picture of a human being , and it &apos;s actually not just a beautiful image .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-56.109802): but if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that the more you have to be able to see the dark , and then you will have no more damage to the ground .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-47.999718): why ? this is the kind of hot and hot , and it &apos;s a little bit of a stick that goes back to the stream .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-73.365448): so , in the lab , if you can take a camera in the office , you can see that it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s safe , and you can actually get it in a light that &apos;s not going to be able to get away .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-12.876739): so , my team at MIT has built the camera ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-90.131393): so , if you &apos;ve seen a film , you can see that you have a very high @-@ speed camera , you can see that it &apos;s not a little bit more difficult than a time , but it &apos;s going to be a little bit more than the Earth .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-100.768852): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;ll see the same thing that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to use this video , and we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more powerful .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-20.685884): and we can use all these data , and actually , to make things very much .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-8.329116): so , Sylvia is able to fly .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-51.087475): voice : can these beautiful , beautiful , invisible , could they be able to make a more vulnerable than a future of a planet ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-7.617085): the idea is that we have to light up .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-47.965668): it &apos;s going to be thrown out in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s going to be able to take the door and see the full of the camera .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-12.451681): and this is not an illusion . we &apos;ve actually been flying .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-7.713829): and let &apos;s see the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-19.259506): and on the wall , there &apos;s a wall that &apos;s behind the door .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-50.873924): when the book was written in our work , it &apos;s been made by the British Journal of Medicine , and it &apos;s made out of these things .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-162.357147): we can send these red light @-@ up , and the signal is that every single one of these light @-@ up , and then the signal is going to be the most sensitive , and then we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of the air , and then the signal is that it &apos;s going to be made in the back of the air , and then they will be able to get to get a little bit more .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-20.252995): and the camera is like we have a camera that &apos;s all very close to the camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-20.199692): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s going to be able to see the world in the air .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-46.939983): so , we know that the presence of the body , but it &apos;s not the point of view , because we have to remember the point of the road .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-127.243134): if we &apos;re going to show a laser , which is a little bit like this , and we can see that the camera is going to be able to see the sound of the screen , and then we can see that it &apos;s going to be able to do something that &apos;s going to be made up with these little light , and then we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-3.903865): can we go in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-6.319027): so here &apos;s the I@@ RA .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-135.113007): we have to do something that we &apos;ve got to do with the first step in , and we can imagine that if we can go back to the outside , and see that the next step is to try to figure out what &apos;s going to be able to see in the air , and we can see that we can &apos;t see the most complex , and then we can take out of the long @-@ term .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-99.904724): and because of course , the de@@ code is so powerful that we can actually take a long time to see that the technology is actually a part of the research that &apos;s going to be able to take a second @-@ class , and it &apos;s a very important tool for the future .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-126.681328): so , as an artist , in fact , in fact , is that we &apos;ve been able to show a film that &apos;s only a great science fiction , and it &apos;s not only four years ago , but we can use the images of the universe , and we can see that in the history of the process of the space , and it &apos;s not just a lot of time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-5.913190): but there &apos;s something really happened .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .

Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-5.423095): the waves should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.426760): what &apos;s happening ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-44.199055): it &apos;s actually because we thought that we could have a lot of light , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in the very first time .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-59.659882): in the past , in the context of the experiment , it &apos;s been shown in the position of the space , and then it &apos;s not going to be able to use the memory .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-148.366852): instead of giving us a new , like , to be able to take the knowledge of the creation of our own imagination and the most important information , the tools of the world , to take out of the back of the museum and the creation of the creation and the four @-@ year @-@ old , and we can use it to be able to take out of the database and use of all the time .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-3.171265): it &apos;s about time . thank you very much .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-6.823509): there are many ways of changing our own lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-42.553162): we don &apos;t have any neighbors in the country , but they &apos;re all going to be able to make sure that the most valuable stuff .

Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-109.328903): yet , there are three people who live in the world , and the more we have to do with the disease , the amount of pain , and the more we have to do , to find the disease that we have to do , to stop the death of the disease , to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-60.417000): we can start to create the open @-@ source , and that &apos;s the only way we can do it , because we have to find that there &apos;s no longer a moment to think about the fact that we have .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-70.841263): so , even though , it &apos;s also a good thing for the patients , and it &apos;s not a good thing to do , and then you can see that there &apos;s a few minutes of the spinal cord .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-32.197296): it &apos;s done to be a hospital , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s not a very expensive one .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-12.829085): but what if patients were going to take this memory ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-27.327631): this is a hospital that could take away from the hospital , and what would you do ?
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-11.885247): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-18.764637): it &apos;s about 250 dollars to make a look at the U.N. .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-57.737644): so I want to do something that we can do in a very short way , because we &apos;re trying to do this , which is , in fact , is that we &apos;re all in the same way .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-14.745215): here &apos;s a video where you see the sound of a magnetic pulse .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-103.425797): the animal is a sense of self @-@ assembly , because we can see that if we &apos;re all going to have a baby , and we can give them all the time to do , we have a lot of mis@@ use , and we can give them the same mis@@ sil@@ es .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.987668): and as we do , it &apos;s a very successful exercise .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-16.523520): think about it , for a long time , you know , you know ,
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-49.713173): so , by the way , we can move the li@@ li@@ b , and the muscles are so close to the li@@ f@@ able .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-34.385017): on the left , you can see a rubber band that &apos;s going to be used on a permanent basis .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-2.751455): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-9.996514): voice , zero @-@ sum .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-20.223724): the language is actually more and more than a piece of speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-152.261307): so the ability to do this , and the ability to do this is to be a multi @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s a lot of attention to the brain , and it &apos;s also a high @-@ tech , but it &apos;s used to be able to read , and we can see that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , that we can be able to get a lot of attention to the computer .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-41.310204): so , if you can do this , we can test them , but in fact , are the clinical trials that are not quite active .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-6.471460): just like the infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-9.328897): you have no need to build new jobs .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-5.646307): and they are both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.552664): so they can be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-5.070874): they &apos;re very , very quickly .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-7.555690): we &apos;re very cheap , and we know what this is called .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-18.093281): and if you &apos;re extremely cheap , it &apos;s actually a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-9.799934): so the goals that we can do .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-10.784357): we can help the low @-@ cost .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-15.917457): patients don &apos;t have to put a pill in the clinic .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-18.295179): we can use the data to restore collective phenomena .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.571625): we can use the same @-@ effective treatment for the first time , and we can actually study a number of studies .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-20.582478): now we have the first time to explore the microbial community , which is to kill for the disease .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-28.981928): now , we &apos;re going to take the first step in , and we &apos;re going to get the key to the user .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-69.944946): and I have a par@@ ab@@ i@@ ting , with a free @-@ to @-@ point point , where we can have access to the number of people that have been able to do this for the entire world .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-25.713863): we have a blank slate , and the half of the world is about 100 percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-86.873276): or a keyboard , with a hand@@ bag , you can do that , and we can do four hours of day , we have a full @-@ time to @-@ up , because we have to do something that &apos;s been recorded for about 15 years .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.043162): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-33.576439): if we take thousands of people , you can tell them what we &apos;re going to be , and you can &apos;t care about those .
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.437463): what are you going to do with these all of them ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-27.839329): what happens is that the patient &apos;s attention to the patient &apos;s level , because it &apos;s not a pill .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-13.061118): maybe there are some things that will be done .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-42.611351): but there &apos;s a whole variety of different sources of information that we &apos;re interested in , because it &apos;s very important to show that these are the ones that are affected by the behavior .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-13.021521): now , the average is about 48 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-1.872129): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-59.489323): my father , I &apos;m working on his work , because there &apos;s a great thing that we can do , and it &apos;s so amazing that it &apos;s going to be used to do with the Internet .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-4.088392): this is what I call .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-61.956772): the person can say that , you can take the phone , and you can see the phone , and then you can get the phone out of the person , and then you can get a job .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-1.002501): right .

Ground Truth: thanks , Tom .
Predicted (-0.598035): thank you .
Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-5.912448): I live here in Kenya .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-33.919044): and here &apos;s the father of the mine in the Bronx , and this is the lead @-@ to @-@ the @-@ home .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-61.502647): the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very limited place where the ocean is going to be able to do all the way to do .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-10.629947): the queen , the lions and they do .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-1.631285): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-35.650879): this is one of my kids , and the night was dead , and it was killed . it was all over the morning .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-46.769337): the tribe of the forest , the elephant , and the roots of the ocean are so happy to see all the animals that we &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-6.090631): as a child , I learned to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-29.020697): our soldiers are called the N@@ an@@ ia and the O@@ il .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-2.063526): and kill lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-13.959831): here &apos;s a woman who was running in Sudan .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-27.749981): and I think , in fact , there &apos;s a big threat to the c@@ ron@@ om@@ a .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-25.510441): he was a member of the United States , and my father was six months old .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.524712): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-9.011589): the first idea was , no fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-29.567982): and then , I realized that it &apos;s not really help us to get the dog out of the morning .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.681387): I didn &apos;t have .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-8.849255): I had a second idea . I had a cow .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-15.640245): I wanted to know that the queen was going to hide .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-6.923188): but females are very smart .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-46.666401): you see the walk , and you see the little guy coming back , and they &apos;re going to go back and see that &apos;s not going to happen .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-11.315818): and they take the soil and kill .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.774151): one night , I was walking down to the wall , and I was walking down to the road , and we just got a camera on the left .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-10.663812): no matter what &apos;s happening .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.311246): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-60.469124): and I had a little kid in the summer , and I started to get a little kid , and I started to see that all the time , and I was working on the Internet .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-52.430397): I took a high @-@ powered car , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and you can see the right @-@ hand , which is a sa@@ int .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-17.344547): and I decided to give a light bulb , and the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-7.509675): this is a little black box .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-3.490482): and then I built all together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-29.609715): the solar panels takes the battery , and it &apos;s a 3D printer that takes the battery .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-11.931752): and the two @-@ dimensional light is .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-14.940452): you can see the ra@@ fts that are coming out of the ocean .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-7.054169): so that &apos;s what the lions look like .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-28.841150): the blind lions are coming out of the night , and I &apos;m going to get out of the night .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.043162): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-28.745579): I &apos;ve been working on the home and we had no access to what we &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-5.333728): and then we left our neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.523637): one of them was a grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-28.490149): she had many of her tears , and she was able to see if I left her arm .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.327477): and I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-11.114555): I mean , we can put the camera on the left .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-30.606104): I &apos;ve been living in the house with seven volunteers and then they get to the food .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-63.343369): now , this is a very , very important thing to do , because the can@@ al of the world is to be used to eat the foods , or even the flowers .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
Predicted (-42.772133): a job of a school that I was working on in the South Bronx , and I was teaching a very good school .
Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-20.704163): my new education is to help and get rid of the aid .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-48.739403): I also had my home with kids , and I &apos;m going to go to the store , and we can see it in the world where they &apos;re doing it .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-63.687992): one of the months I was walking through a boy called &quot; The Mar@@ der , &quot; and I was going to go back to my father , &quot; I &apos;ll just see that I was going to do it .

Ground Truth: so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
Predicted (-17.051493): I &apos;m going to be a big pilot , and I &apos;m going to be a designer .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-73.546822): unfortunately , I &apos;ve been able to do that , and I can &apos;t use the music , and I can &apos;t get the message to the war , and we can get a message to the forest .

Ground Truth: my next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
Predicted (-18.458845): so , my first step , is I &apos;m talking about a magnetic field ?
Ground Truth: but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
Predicted (-20.566057): yes , I have a nuclear weapon , but I &apos;m very excited about all the way .
Src: du hast es bereits einmal versucht , nicht wahr - Ja , ich hab &apos; s schon mal versucht , aber den Versuch wieder aufgegeben , weil ich ... einen Schlag bekam .
Ground Truth: you already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
