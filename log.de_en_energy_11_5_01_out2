Predicted (-105.040756): they &apos;re often asked by the way that they &apos;re in the case of the marriage , and it &apos;s a very good one , because they &apos;re in the community of the American community , and they &apos;re not going to be able to talk about the aid of the crime .

Predicted (-76.630844): because I &apos;m in school , when I &apos;m in school , I can teach them to go to the community , and then they can help me go to the school , and then they &apos;re going to be able to take care of the future .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .

Predicted (-65.354744): and when the talks came to this , it was also a really exciting place to go to the door and see that there was a very , very few years ago .
Ground Truth: that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
Predicted (-41.035313): I was always looking at my work , and I was talking about the people who had been doing this , and I was really excited about the world .
Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .

Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-15.880231): we have a tremendous passion for scientists to understand the world .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-72.221695): and our most powerful technologies are in our health , and we don &apos;t know how to deal with the power of technology , and when we talk about it , we &apos;re in fact , there &apos;s no problem , and it &apos;s a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-32.655933): but the amazing thing is that our colleagues are not going to happen to us , because of the people in the business .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-12.328981): so scientists , engineers , designers , and they do it .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-50.540310): I &apos;ll show you some of the things that we can do , and let me show you a little bit of what we can do is start to study the technology that &apos;s going to be .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-17.230927): the first question that you have to do is , and they &apos;re like , right ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-16.246481): now , you know , this is a global basis for what &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-90.907822): they don &apos;t tell us that they &apos;re just going to be a bit more like this , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to do that because they &apos;re looking at the de@@ code of the bacteria that are in@@ forming and in@@ fer@@ tile .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-19.409279): and what you do is that you make it a mis@@ conception .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-12.869101): there &apos;s a key to understanding .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-40.485073): now , &quot; You know , &quot; Why don &apos;t you have time to go and ask yourself , &quot; Well , why does it work for us ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-23.318741): you don &apos;t understand what the quality of your mind is to be able to do .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-21.553854): Einstein said that the way that &apos;s done , but it &apos;s not possible .
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-33.682110): you can tell us a lot of un@@ prepared , but you have to do something in the world .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-29.017492): there &apos;s some things that are important to do , and we can tell you about these things .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-19.228464): and if you have your work , you can get the credit .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-12.292634): now you have to ask yourself , &quot; Why is it ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-37.167957): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a conversation , and then you get it into your pocket .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-34.581646): so this is not a little bit like this , but it &apos;s actually a very close @-@ to @-@ up gap .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-84.053741): so , the Di@@ on@@ on@@ on@@ on@@ ic is an amazing thing that it &apos;s known to be the most important thing that we &apos;ve ever described is that the visual structure of the system is the inter@@ dependence .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-91.000214): one is the only one that &apos;s the only way that I can use a computer to do with the fact that it &apos;s a little bit more , and that &apos;s what it means to do with the user , and the more it &apos;s going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-34.555290): so there &apos;s some of these guys who are trying to open up the door , and that &apos;s what the science is going to go to the community .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
Predicted (-62.792194): the engineers have taught me that I have a 3D printer , and I have to do something that is to make a sense of what I call &quot; a whole @-@ to @-@ make . &quot;
Ground Truth: take your science , subtra@@ ct your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .

Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-46.741962): you know , it &apos;s all like the guy who &apos;s going to be on the front of these giant chicken @-@ like .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-65.929474): and the rest of the house was so clear that the president is not going to be married , because the majority of you have to say , &quot; You know , the president is a child .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-8.677135): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-47.574711): the ideas are to try to understand the reality of the language , and to change the reality , not only as a result of the same time .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.087276): thank you very much .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-67.698578): I went to a farm with a very small farm in Afghanistan , which is about one of the most famous fish in the late 1990s , with a suicide bomber of Abu Ghraib .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-61.704247): I was wearing a three @-@ pound s@@ uns@@ ol@@ ar and a half @-@ hour fire@@ flies , and I could actually have a gun on the ground .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-3.016212): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-168.408218): and after that , I was working with a long time for a long time , a long time of the American and the American family , and we had to go to the K@@ ig@@ ali and a little girl who was talking about the world of the world , and they were able to take the food and go to the O@@ val@@ in@@ go and go to the shopping party .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-7.344516): but that &apos;s the self @-@ preservation .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-91.172737): so here I &apos;m not a Muslim @-@ lived , the West of the United States , and the Jewish Jewish community , with a long time of war , and the war in the world is a business plan .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-140.212982): now , there &apos;s a great thing to do with these beautiful things , not to do , but I can teach them to find out that there &apos;s a real world of the art and the most beautiful , and to try to make a sense of self @-@ assembly , and to try to make the difference , and to make sure that it &apos;s not a single thing that we can do .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-103.020569): I have a day to live in a new country called &quot; The Mon@@ al &quot; and &quot; a great deal of mis@@ sil@@ es , &quot; the secret of violence , &quot; and they &apos;re talking about the mis@@ ar@@ tions of the terrorists .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-45.408424): and what the translator can do is do to do with a foreign campaign , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; Here &apos;s a Nigerian party . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-40.347717): and to try to do this , to create the company that &apos;s not using the bur@@ gl@@ ings of the time .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-136.937866): I &apos;m going to talk about the problem of the city , and the police in the U.S. , is to give them a little bit of a legal system , and they &apos;re not going to give them a sign of the money that they &apos;re going to be in the streets of the streets , and they &apos;re going to be able to take out of the garbage .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-27.657684): I think that in my opinion , the conflict of Afghanistan is going to be a post @-@ conflict .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-163.103683): the rab@@ bi has been able to do this , and then it &apos;s a way to do that , in a way , with a long time , and then you can use the non @-@ lethal , un@@ can@@ ni@@ te , and then you can create a new re@@ cess for the city of the city of the Al@@ ps , and then you can put them in the back to the ground .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-164.901169): and I &apos;ll like to give you a little bit of a &quot; The New Yorker &quot; actually , &quot; the way that the National Security Council is to take a look at the time of the war of the world is to take a look at the fact that there &apos;s a little bit of the de@@ code of the A@@ .D. &quot; and the O@@ ven &apos;s &quot; to take out of the war .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-29.565052): but for all of these things , you can go into them , you know , they &apos;re not going to be compassionate .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-15.996159): but I do it because it &apos;s the way we need to hide the self .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-6.049052): that &apos;s my input .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.375190): thank you .
Src: Hi . mein Name ist Cameron Russell und seit einiger Zeit arbeite ich als Model .
Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-20.124319): Hi . my name is a cotton and a nonprofit .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-4.067136): 10 years ago ,
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-57.483147): I mean , this is a sense of being in a room that I &apos;ve been able to put up a box that &apos;s not going to be in a permanent fashion .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-12.877864): fortunately , I have a little bit of what I do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-31.904480): this is the first time that you get to hear someone &apos;s talk about , and I think you &apos;re going to be happy .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-45.661423): and I have a lot of people , because I &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re going to do it , and I &apos;ll tell you that the first time .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-26.722694): I &apos;m actually in a very , very difficult point , because I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-7.656650): no one has to do that .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-23.573734): these are very low @-@ lying , and I don &apos;t know that they &apos;re okay .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-38.810623): the key part is that I &apos;m going to do something like this , because I &apos;m going to tell you that your head is too bad .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.459527): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.222711): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-2.827480): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-15.649322): now , I was not sure that this was like a moment .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-11.724890): a symbol is something that &apos;s remarkable .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.507978): I &apos;ve been able to focus all over the last 30 seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-16.172352): and this is the moment I had a real girl .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-33.240761): I was very proud of my dad , and I was trying to put up the helmet and put it in my face .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-105.714432): and at the time , the A@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ ting , it &apos;s a little bit of time to make it a little bit more difficult than that , and I think that it &apos;s not only in our lives .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-10.163174): it &apos;s easier to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-6.313760): I &apos;m sitting on this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-27.756680): I &apos;m on the side of this , because I &apos;m a young girl , and I &apos;m a good man .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-31.361454): I &apos;m going to ask the question that people are now , and I &apos;ll ask you to do the most .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.592588): the first question is , how do you do ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.338433): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been saying that .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-40.700287): the reason I think that the public is a kind of a brand @-@ like version of this , and it &apos;s a very important example .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-79.036339): now , most of us have been in the deep @-@ century , and we &apos;re not very good at finding beauty and beauty , but they &apos;re also a very , very similar to the old , and so on .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-12.392869): this is a legacy , and it &apos;s made for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-79.842392): there &apos;s a very good audience . I think that there &apos;s a lot of people who are in the morning , and they &apos;re like to be a bit of a ra@@ w@@ ning , and it &apos;s called &quot; R@@ ace . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-15.432562): and then I want to show you a very , very impressive .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-117.196030): but I &apos;ve shown you that in the last four years , in fact , the first one of the four @-@ year @-@ olds , and the only one that &apos;s known to be able to do that , but the F@@ M @-@ 3 @-@ hour , and the only one is that it &apos;s not going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-37.484612): the next question is , &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , if I &apos;m going to be a game called , &quot; This is a pen@@ sity ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.495077): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know that there &apos;s no responsibility . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-18.895178): but the second one I want to do is , &quot; Why are we going to have some girls ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-3.738225): you know what ? you can .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-52.330620): you can have the U.S. or the American citizen , and the person in the morning is a big mis@@ conception of what I want to do .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-43.176006): and when you &apos;re talking about this , it &apos;s not a big fan , I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not going to be a pilot . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-72.081367): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , but it &apos;s not the most important thing to do with the American and the M@@ .D. / A @-@ A @-@ E @-@ by @-@ the @-@ state .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-39.300690): so , you know , if you want to do something like that , you &apos;ll have to say that the lottery is going to be a bit more .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-15.229518): it can &apos;t be understood and it &apos;s not going to be awesome .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-30.730343): now I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s a very different concept of control .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-145.711029): there &apos;s a little man who &apos;s in the middle of the elevator , and then you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a baby , and then you can see that the next one is , and then you can see the foot of the wing , and then the robot is just just going to go back to the end of the day , and then you &apos;re going to go back to the old .
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-5.583206): it &apos;s about that .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-8.781961): sometimes this is a little bit more like that .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-12.616069): I was like , &quot; Oh , I didn &apos;t know what happened .
Predicted (-106.904358): so , a school teacher has a little bit of a school , and it &apos;s not going to be in the room , but if you &apos;re going to go to the school , you can say , &quot; You know , you &apos;ll have a lot of money in the middle of the U.S. , you &apos;ll have a few minutes . &quot;
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-15.638324): so the question that I asked is , &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-31.493990): now , these guys are pretty much , but it &apos;s just a little bit of a re@@ cess .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-36.989765): this is the first one that I did . I was actually a photograph that I was doing , and I was at the end of the night .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
Predicted (-13.671983): I know that &apos;s true , but I &apos;m a very lucky person .
Ground Truth: this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .

Predicted (-10.903953): and I hope you &apos;ll see these pictures , not all of us .
Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-66.874825): there are groups of artists and artists , and they are all the kind of par@@ ting and the open @-@ source of the tools that are available to the people , and they &apos;re all in the audience .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-19.495617): now , the next thing you ask , &quot; How do you get all the stuff ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-67.837982): I have a number of men who have no extra @-@ to @-@ one @-@ day , but I &apos;m not going to do anything that I can do , because I have the most important things that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
Predicted (-30.605705): I went to a school in Chicago , and I got a good school , and I got to give up all the money .
Ground Truth: when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
Predicted (-98.244926): when I was a kid , I was a very shy , and I got a bad news , and I got a phone call , and I &apos;d never know that she was going to go back and go , and we got a little bit of a ra@@ cist .
Ground Truth: and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
Predicted (-52.332703): I have no idea of these things , because there &apos;s no difference , and I can tell you that there &apos;s no good news for people who are in their home .
Ground Truth: I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
Predicted (-57.563644): I live in New York , and the majority of the U.S. and the people who are in the high @-@ tech and more often are in the &apos; 60s .
Ground Truth: and there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-44.137070): it &apos;s about 12 @-@ year @-@ old New York , and the homeless woman is not about to say , &quot; Why are I going to be doing this ? &quot;
Src: sondern : &quot; wie oft werde ich angehalten ? wann werde ich angehalten ? &quot;
Ground Truth: but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-6.613664): but how often do I go ? &quot;
Ground Truth: when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
Predicted (-68.634140): and I learned that my research on this line is that if you were at the end of the four @-@ year @-@ old women , they were not able to do that , and they &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Src: die letzte Frage an mich lautet : &quot; wie ist es , ein Model zu sein ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
Predicted (-8.152490): the final question is , &quot; How is it possible ? &quot;

Ground Truth: but most people don &apos;t agree .

Ground Truth: and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and misunderstood .
Predicted (-53.804962): because of course , the language of the world is not necessarily a good @-@ being @-@ made , and they &apos;re actually going to be more comfortable .
Ground Truth: but what lifted my heart and strength@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .

Ground Truth: now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .

Predicted (-78.582474): he was in his own life , and he was in the kitchen , and he had a good idea of living in the house , and he had a little bit of the food , and he was able to put on the floor .
Ground Truth: and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Predicted (-10.658512): and when he was older , he was so different .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .

Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-74.093376): but I started to talk about the idea of making music , and I think that it &apos;s all about the things that we have to be able to do , and I have to talk about the power of empathy , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-28.293648): the beauty of the activity is that we can tell ourselves , and that &apos;s not the opposite of us .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-13.570563): it &apos;s just a sense of being a single one .

Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-6.732003): you can be quite extraordinary .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-82.838043): but there are no single , there &apos;s no one -- we &apos;re all happy to be the only person , and we have a gift to the extent that we have to be a universal , and that &apos;s the most important thing .

Predicted (-52.895718): so I &apos;ll show you a new video of the process that &apos;s been used to be a multi @-@ dimensional space that allows us to capture the speed of light .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-67.922180): so we can take the camera to see the space of our eyes and try to see what &apos;s going on to be able to use a piece of light , and we can actually see the next door .
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-132.466949): now , I &apos;ll give you an extra @-@ time perspective , and that &apos;s a little bit of a partial partial signal -- and that &apos;s why it &apos;s a little bit like a double @-@ str@@ anded , and that &apos;s the speed of the Earth , and it &apos;s a little bit like a multi @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-56.189701): so , if you take this piece of a magnetic pulse , you &apos;ll put the balloon into the ice , and you can get into the bottle of the bottle .

Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-3.270205): so , this whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-85.417694): so , of course , this is a rocket that &apos;s going to take a little bit of time , and it &apos;s about the speed of the light that you can see , but it &apos;s a little bit like this , and then you can put the screen in the air .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-10.122853): no , Coca @-@ Cola has this .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-14.183459): so in this movie , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of fun .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-64.375290): so , the next piece of a magnetic field that &apos;s called the Sp@@ ash , which is a balloon that &apos;s going to turn up and turn it into a little bit .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-31.701359): and it &apos;s a little bit of the water that &apos;s coming up and you see the waves .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-35.528831): the most surprising thing is that the neuron has come up with a lot of the extra .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-24.666092): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that &apos;s going to take a little bit of the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-70.554733): the walls are coming up in the area , and the amount of sound is that they &apos;re coming from the walls , and they &apos;re going to be used to be a few of the le@@ ague .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-80.259377): so if you have a video of the first time , and you have to see the ball of the screen , and we &apos;re going to take a look at the same time , and we &apos;re going to have to go back to the moon for about 10 minutes .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-5.571382): a week , a day ? no .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-17.855835): this is a very boring -- a little bit of a human being .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-16.249886): and what does it live with a little bit of excitement ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-42.521137): you can see the walls , and the R@@ ace of the waves , and the background is the sign of the wall .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-10.768679): it &apos;s like a rock in a shoe .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-45.269215): and I thought that it was just like a photograph of the animal , and it &apos;s actually a true picture of all of us .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-59.924500): but if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s some more dark spots that you have to keep in the water , and then you &apos;ll see that the secret is going to be .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-42.557072): this is why the light is that it &apos;s all the way to get a stick and put it in a few seconds .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-69.511635): so , in the lab , if you can take a camera in the office , you can see that it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to be able to go into a piano , and it &apos;s a little bit more .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-11.108823): so , my team at MIT has built ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-80.316689): now , as you see , you know , a few minutes , you can see that the camera is a little bit more difficult than you have to do , and you can see that the Earth is a little bit more difficult for a time .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-103.182831): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to take this video , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the data that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we &apos;re going to use this amazing , and then we can see the most amazing thing .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-20.344006): and we can use all these data , and actually , to make the difference .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-8.937067): so , Sylvia is able to fly .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-52.422237): voice : can these beautiful creatures be able to make a true , but it can be more like a world @-@ like @-@ making creature .
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-8.258330): the idea is that we have to light up .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-55.523354): it &apos;s going to be thrown out in the center of the room , and it &apos;s going to be able to get out of the door , and then we can see the camera in the back of the day .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-11.189016): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve actually got it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.537734): and you see the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-24.733349): and on the wall , it &apos;s a wall where we &apos;re going to get the door .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-47.861004): when the book was written in our work , it &apos;s been made of a collaborative consumption , it &apos;s made of research .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-175.983337): we can send these red light @-@ up , and the next wave of light , and then the signal is that every single one of these things will be made , and then they &apos;re going to be able to get into the ears , and then they &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of the light , and then you can see that the most powerful and the amount of light that comes from the sound that comes from the rest of the sound that comes from our bodies .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-20.050676): and so we have a camera that &apos;s all around us is actually a camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-20.903368): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s a very good thing to see in the world .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-52.591019): so , we know that the presence of the time , but it &apos;s not the point of the connection to the outside , and it &apos;s not what we want to do .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-120.907364): if we &apos;re going to show a laser , which is a little bit like this , and we can see that the camera is going to be able to see a little bit of the light that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we &apos;re going to see that , and then we &apos;re going to do that , and then we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-4.137440): can we go into 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-6.900752): so here &apos;s the I@@ RA .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-141.127106): we have to do this experiment , and we can imagine that if we can take a few more time to try to figure out what &apos;s going on in the lab , and we can see that the outside of the world is to be able to take the air , and to see that we can take a little bit of a few @-@ dimensional , and then we can take it out of the right @-@ time .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-95.163170): and because of the ad@@ vent of the fact that this is a multi @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s a very difficult tool to actually take a tool to actually take away from the human mind , and that &apos;s a great @-@ time time @-@ to @-@ the @-@ day research .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-109.335625): so , as an artist , in fact , in fact , is that we have a great science fiction fiction , and it &apos;s a very simple piece of music , and it &apos;s not only a four @-@ year @-@ old movie that we can see in the history of the world , but it &apos;s also a lot of time that we &apos;ve been able to use .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-6.416704): but there &apos;s something really happened .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-32.887856): if you look at the waves of the sand , you &apos;ll see that the wave of the coral .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-5.884564): the waves should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.570111): what &apos;s happening ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-51.516159): it &apos;s actually because we &apos;ve got to see that we &apos;re going to have a very , very high @-@ resolution , and that &apos;s what we would like to see .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-58.874504): in the past , in the context of the moment , it &apos;s been shown in the center of the sphere , and it &apos;s not possible to put in the memory of the space .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-154.240280): instead of giving us a new tool , like the <blank> <blank> <blank> tical , and all of us , to take out of the data and to take out of our own knowledge and the pro@@ creation of the creation of our culture and the scientific tool , to create the most amazing images of the world , and we can take out of the time and go back to the back .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-3.668280): it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-7.080404): there are many ways of changing our own lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-60.252949): we don &apos;t have a woman who are on the street , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do all the way to make sure that they &apos;re all on the road .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .

Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-47.185890): working together is a very high @-@ income , and it &apos;s a very unique component of the least known as a technical component .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-53.362034): now , Sylvia Browne is very important for the moment , and this is a very good way to do this with a human being .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-14.440541): and over the years , we &apos;ve been able to do a lot of research .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-120.868515): yet , there are three people who are still living in the world , and the amount of food that we have to do is to have the same disease that we have to do with the death of the disease , and the more people who have to do it , to try to save the long @-@ term , and to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-69.543732): we can do the ability to do it , and we can only have to be able to do that , and we can find that the only way we have to do it is to be a sense of time .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-58.698650): so , in fact , there &apos;s no good activity , and it &apos;s also a good thing for the patients , and it &apos;s a very good thing to do .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-32.979893): it &apos;s done to be a hospital , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s not a very expensive one .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-13.736882): but what if patients were going to take a test ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-28.198933): this is a hospital that could take away from the hospital , and what would you do ?
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-11.850218): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-15.378423): it &apos;s about 250 dollars to make a drug .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-47.249954): so I want to do something that &apos;s very useful for you to do , because we can do this in the past , and that &apos;s what we do .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-16.000221): here &apos;s a video where you see the sound of a magnetic pulse .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-105.081802): the animal is a sense of self @-@ assembly , because we can see that if we &apos;re all going to have a good message , we can get rid of the pain , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of these neurons , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-15.560196): and we &apos;re going to do it with a lot of practice .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-16.908901): think about it , for a long time , you know , it &apos;s a kid .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-45.810478): so , by the way , we can move the li@@ li@@ li@@ b , and you can see the sound of the spinal cord .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-14.925426): on the left , you can see a rubber band .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-2.805079): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-13.872725): voice , C , etc .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-20.649464): the person is actually playing with a more and more of the speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-145.862869): so the ability to do this , and the ability to do this is to be a multi @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s a lot of attention to the brain , and it &apos;s also a good @-@ time time @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ hand , because it &apos;s a multi @-@ hour @-@ old , and it &apos;s what we can do .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-40.429569): so , if you can do this , you can see , in fact , are the clinical trials , they &apos;re not at least clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-7.049923): just like the infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.971279): you have no need to build a new factory .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-5.408564): and they &apos;re both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.355937): so they can be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-5.773617): they &apos;re very , very fast .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-8.391693): we &apos;re very cheap , and we know what this is called .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-20.872112): and if you &apos;re a very cheap , it &apos;s actually a lot of things .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-11.095511): so these are the goals that we can do .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-11.117855): we can help the severe health .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-22.083321): patients have no license to do the cost of a cup of coffee .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-17.941277): we can use the data to restore planetary .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-38.090382): we can use the same @-@ effective treatment for the first time , and we can actually take a number of clinical trials .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-24.706825): now we have the first time to explore the microbial community , to find out the disease for a minute .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-22.075766): now , we &apos;re going to do this right now , and we &apos;re going to start the key .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-70.101639): and I have a live @-@ up , with a free @-@ to @-@ hand , and we have to have a number of people in the world that we can do with the minimum minimum value .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-28.756762): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and the half of the planet is about 100 percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-70.782654): or a keyboard , with a hand@@ bag , you can do it , with four @-@ minute , we can have a four @-@ year @-@ old , which is a lot of time to do it .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.032605): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-36.446831): if we take some of them , you can tell people who are going to be on , and you can tell them what &apos;s going to be healthy ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.545466): what are you going to do with these all of them ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-36.963398): what happens is that the patient has to be in front of the patient &apos;s attention , and it &apos;s not a matter of time .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-12.078896): maybe you &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-59.196377): there &apos;s a huge variety of different sources of information , because we &apos;re interested in what these are are the most important ones that are in the field of visual areas that are used to be .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-16.384922): now , the average of them is 0.@@ 7 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.158165): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-58.135101): my father , I was working on this project , and it &apos;s amazing that it &apos;s not going to be able to do this for a company , because it &apos;s so important to do that .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-4.177505): this is what I call .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-62.675720): the person can say that you can take the phone , and then you can get the phone , and you can get the phone out of the person , and then you can get the attention to the program .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-0.797618): right .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-5.991095): I live here in Kenya .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-35.041332): and here &apos;s the father of the mine in the Bronx , and this is the lead @-@ to @-@ the @-@ home .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-37.541344): the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very protected area where the ocean is .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-11.442193): the queen , the lions and they do .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-1.866286): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-30.538057): this is one of my father , and every night , I was in the morning , and she was dead .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-45.555191): the tribe of the forest , the elephant , and the elephant is so close to our bodies , and we all have to do that .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-6.637069): as a child , I learned to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-27.461456): our soldiers are called the O@@ il and the O@@ il .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-2.461314): and kill lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-13.990888): here &apos;s a woman who was running in Portugal .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-37.320740): and I think there &apos;s a very good way to do it in the U.S. -- there &apos;s no more co@@ al@@ es .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-27.090302): he was a member of the United States , and my father was about two months .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.762648): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-7.065077): the first idea was to fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-32.929832): and then I realized that it &apos;s not going to help us , but the doctors could help us to stop the street .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.809869): I didn &apos;t have .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-8.956230): I had a second idea . I had a cow .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-8.906080): I wanted to kill the hall .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-7.533824): but females are very smart .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-51.921356): you see the walk , and you see the little guy , and you &apos;ll see that the guy &apos;s going to go back and go back and go back .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-11.494301): and they take the soil and kill .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-44.900902): I was walking down at the moment , and I was walking down to the street , and I just got a camera on the left .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-11.140381): no matter what &apos;s happening .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.389258): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-84.507332): and I was a little kid in the summer , and I started getting a little kid , and I started to get out of my entire life , and I started to see that the phone was not going to be used to be a lot of the computer .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-39.553951): I took a high @-@ powered car , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and you can see the blue line .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-18.645851): I decided to give a light bulb , and the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-7.015018): this is a little black box .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-3.696374): and then I built all together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-35.492828): the solar battery is the energy that takes a 3D printer and it &apos;s called the pan@@ cy .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-13.865844): and the virtual sphere is a light .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-15.980512): you can see the ra@@ fts that are coming out of the ocean .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-8.243073): so this is what the lions look like .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-26.910057): the blind is the panic , and I can see the flowers in the morning .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.032605): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-29.618086): I &apos;ve been working on the home and we had no access to what we &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-5.596503): and then we left our neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.758618): one of them was a grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-33.548531): she had been living in tears , and she was able to see why they were taking the lights .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.412455): and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-12.880476): I mean , we can put the lights on the screen .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-31.890049): I &apos;ve been living in the house with seven volunteers and then they have access to the food .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-66.674744): now , this is a very good thing , because it &apos;s not used to be used to be a lot of food , but it &apos;s used to be used to protect the most of the world .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .

Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-66.835953): I took my home to the office , and I also have kids to go and buy them in the way that we can see , and it &apos;s where we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-61.009956): one of the time I was a little boy from a father , and he was sitting in a little town of England , and I would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to take a piece of paper . &quot;

Predicted (-16.920143): I &apos;m going to be a big pilot , and I &apos;m going to be a designer .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-65.956543): and I &apos;ve been able to do that , because I can &apos;t have the power of the day , and I can go to the Koran , and we can &apos;t get the message .
Predicted (-24.671265): O@@ MA : I have a very good name . thank you very much .

Ground Truth: there were no art directors , no sty@@ lists , no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots , not even any regard for lighting .
Predicted (-24.905426): there was no <blank> <blank> ly , no one , no one on the right side .
Ground Truth: in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
Predicted (-16.660259): and it &apos;s true to be the most popular ones .
Ground Truth: my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7th and 5@@ th .
Predicted (-72.509941): my story was a student at the time , and I was sitting in my head of this day , and I was at the moment of my talk , and this is the only one of the five @-@ year @-@ old girls .
Ground Truth: we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Predicted (-36.895866): so in a year , we started to go back and see this next week , and we were going to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: well you can see where this is going .
Predicted (-8.850307): well , you can see where the wheel is going .
Ground Truth: approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a father @-@ daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
Predicted (-58.387577): and my mother , when the daughter told me that she was a friend of mine , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take a day and ask her to go to the school of the city ? &quot;
Src: damals fingen wir an , vorbei@@ laufende Touristen zu bitten , ein Bild von uns zu machen .
Ground Truth: this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
Predicted (-38.111919): so , we started to start to see some of these things , and we would just take a picture .
Ground Truth: you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total stranger .
Predicted (-35.322575): what &apos;s remarkable is that you can see the most common memory of your individual is just a nice spot .
Ground Truth: no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Predicted (-25.785328): nobody has always been lucky , and nobody has ever been told for a good time .

Ground Truth: so these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
Predicted (-20.273491): these are thousands of times more than any one , but it &apos;s a certain way .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Predicted (-56.787018): they are in a moment for our generation , and for example , in the past , in the time , we have no longer been able to go back and go to the same time .
Ground Truth: because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mile@@ stones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
Predicted (-58.278595): but the same thing is that we &apos;re seeing our lives , and it &apos;s going to be able to see the whole pace of time , and it &apos;s not about how to do it .
Ground Truth: this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticipate the entire year .
Predicted (-31.276726): so , the most important thing we do is we &apos;re spending a little bit of time and we &apos;re going to stop .
Ground Truth: recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
Predicted (-91.624313): so , in a while , we went back to a school where they were doing a lot of food , and they were able to do this , and then they were able to see a drop of a drop of food in the middle of the day .
Ground Truth: and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
Predicted (-20.050373): and she told me that her husband was at the end of the age of this little age .
Src: sie sagte , dass sie sich daran erinnert wie ihr das Herz aus der Brust sprang , als sie vor neun Jahren den Laden zum ersten Mal sah .
Ground Truth: she said she remembers her heart bur@@ sting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
Predicted (-46.944504): she said that she was the only way she was looking at her heart of the death row , and she was at the time of the hospital .
Ground Truth: and now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
Predicted (-27.151455): but they go to New York , because they &apos;re in a very high school in the world .
Src: und mir wurde schlag@@ artig klar : das Wichtigste , was wir alle erschaffen , sind Erinnerungen .
Ground Truth: and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
Predicted (-24.872009): and I realized that what &apos;s important is , in our own sense , we have all the things .
Ground Truth: so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
Predicted (-21.233461): and so I want to share with you a unique idea of creating a kind of empathy .
Ground Truth: I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
Predicted (-27.710548): I don &apos;t know what it looks like , but I &apos;m not sure that this is a typical student .

Ground Truth: I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
Predicted (-8.902107): I &apos;m always the one that &apos;s doing .
Ground Truth: so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hes@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Predicted (-41.454353): I want to leave you with all of us with a sudden , and I would like to tell you that you &apos;re going to be a girl or a picture .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you .
