Predicted (-48.605774): but when I &apos;m in the middle of the school , I &apos;m going to tell you that the kids are going to be a part of the interest and the interest of it .

Ground Truth: but as these conversations un@@ folded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
Predicted (-46.705299): but when the press started to look at the city , it was a very difficult way to see the difference between them and the one .
Ground Truth: that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
Predicted (-39.387951): I was interested in the fact that I had to talk about the people who were in the same way , and I was thinking about it .
Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
Predicted (-16.800375): I want to open this , because there &apos;s a passion for everyone .
Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-24.894510): we need to create a great idea of the media and all of our things .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-73.198891): our problems with the problems and the global economy , and we have to understand how we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re not really interested in what we &apos;re doing , because there &apos;s a lot of things that we can do .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-30.198959): so , these are not really great scientists , because we &apos;re going to take our place for granted .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-17.088194): so scientists , engineers , and we &apos;re going to be on .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-41.498703): I want you to show you a little bit of the technology that we can do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s the way that you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-10.683721): the first question is , you know , what is it going to be ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-22.695480): and what &apos;s really important is that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-71.873672): they don &apos;t know that they &apos;re going to be a bit more , but they &apos;re actually going to be able to understand the structure of the Higgs field , and that &apos;s what we call the &quot; complex &quot; .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-26.049255): and what you do is , if you remove the word , it &apos;s going to be saved .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-14.717366): memory is a kind of cognitive ability .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-48.679573): &quot; you don &apos;t have to do this , but what is really going to be , and it &apos;s a lot of time , and what does you do ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-26.471889): you can &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s the same way that you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-19.347984): and I said , &quot; Well , the way that works is not just like this . &quot;
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-19.649649): you can tell you that a lot of information that &apos;s going to be done .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-43.478054): so , one of the things that we &apos;re doing is , in some ways , I think , you can bring a story to these two things .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-15.119954): and if you want to do that , you get the job .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-12.821404): you &apos;ve got to ask yourself , &quot; What is this ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-28.789459): what happens if you &apos;re going to be a little bit , and then you can see a difference between them .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-47.164417): and this is a very simple example , because it &apos;s not just the way we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s very important to the physical part of the body .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-70.628204): the latest artist , which is a very powerful piece of paper , which is very important because it &apos;s the fact that they use to be the most sophisticated material that we call it .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-84.264229): the second one is that we can take a piece of the Web , and it &apos;s a piece of content , and it &apos;s just a way that you can see , because it &apos;s the ability to communicate with the same kind of information .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-39.088730): so , there &apos;s a few people who are going to be able to build the art and the arts that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
Predicted (-40.015991): and the scientists who I &apos;ve been working on , and I said , &quot; I have to use a kind of a special device . &quot;
Ground Truth: take your science , subtra@@ ct your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
Predicted (-94.352341): so , you &apos;ll be using your own personal personal ideas , and you &apos;ll see that the value of the game , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s a great success , which is that you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
Ground Truth: and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
Predicted (-29.742863): and so the scientists , if you have a theory , it &apos;s really going to be able to do this .

Predicted (-27.760498): I wrote a book , &quot; The most popular thing is , &quot; and there &apos;s nothing to do .
Ground Truth: and the reason for the delay and the bor@@ e@@ dom was that the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives were against the Senate .
Predicted (-42.260769): the reason for the genocide was that the FBI was just a lot of the air and the court .
Ground Truth: the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives didn &apos;t want Washington to get drunk on power .
Predicted (-32.554413): the building was not going to be able to buy it , because they didn &apos;t want to be in the movie .
Ground Truth: they didn &apos;t want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his success@@ or ideas .
Predicted (-21.288120): and he says , &quot; There &apos;s no way to do this in the way .
Ground Truth: so they wanted to give him the hum@@ bl@@ est , me@@ ager@@ est , most pathetic title that they could think of .
Predicted (-28.442989): they had to be the most aggressive , and they would say , &quot; That &apos;s the most dangerous thing .

Ground Truth: this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dig@@ nit@@ aries .

Ground Truth: and who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a silly little title like President of the United States of America ?

Src: und auch nach 3 Wochen Debatte gab der Senat nicht nach .
Ground Truth: and after three weeks of debate , in the end the Senate did not cave in .
Predicted (-17.264549): and then , in fact , there was no competition for the first .
Ground Truth: instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under Republican or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chief magi@@ strate , titles of respect@@ ability -- not bloody President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maje@@ sty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ularity , i@@ .@@ e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
Predicted (-120.734261): and finally , they were trying to convince us that the government of the world is not just to be able to do it , but in the &apos; 60s , the &apos; 60s , the &apos; 60s , the &apos; 60s , the idea of the government , the government is not just a good way of being able to do .
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.706152): you can also find a little bit of questions .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-36.315861): and the first thing I &apos;ve got to do is -- I &apos;m sure that the answer is to all the time in the United States .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-42.581440): the President Obama said , &quot; The only thing that has been done is to be able to get rid of it .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-34.798763): and you think that the first thing you can do is , if you have a government , it &apos;s almost impossible .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-38.021950): and the second thing is , the only thing that is , is that the last thing in America is that it &apos;s not true for democracy ?
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-44.427200): and the whole thing that we &apos;ve got to do is to take the largest and put it on the planet , and we &apos;ve got a lot of carbon dioxide .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-15.503391): and the story of what you have was called the universe .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-11.927211): and this is the only one that I did .

Predicted (-6.624230): they have a lesson .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-26.098742): and the other hand of the lack of knowledge , which I was very lucky .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-8.885612): but how do you know , a lot of Americans ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-4.300052): AB : 16 .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-36.710438): because they &apos;re just like the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing with a hundred @-@ dollar gas .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-49.746887): so the only thing that you have to do is , because if you have a heart attack , you know , the president is still going to be in jail .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-13.766581): and that &apos;s the most important thing I can do with you , and I &apos;m going to show you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .

Predicted (-50.569366): so I went to a small school in the United States , and it was a very high @-@ tech , a great deal of evil .

Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .

Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.250962): that was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .

Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-6.508623): but this is the architecture of the other .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-53.506947): so , I &apos;m here , and the one of the most famous people in the United States , has been a non @-@ lethal weapon for the state of Ghana .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-115.139801): we know that there &apos;s a lot of people in the world , and I can &apos;t be able to do it , and I think , in a sense , the way that the music is to be a kind of a re@@ creation of the world , and it &apos;s a way to create a lot of the way to make it happen .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-79.826973): I have a world where the best way to do is to be a family , a non @-@ lethal , a mon@@ archy , and it &apos;s called &quot; Li@@ d@@ y@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-67.484718): and if the problem is to take a business and take a name of the &quot; I &apos;m going to do with a job , &quot; and I &apos;m not going to have to do it .

Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-36.137894): and this is what they call to the government to do , to make a lot of the insurance industry .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-109.767487): and I want to give you a problem in the U.S. , and the reason is that the police are going to go to the market , and they &apos;re not going to be able to use a lot of people who are going to take their own shoes and put them in the back of the car .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-37.945538): I think of the conflict as a result of the West , and I was in a situation where the government is .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-115.471458): and the government was able to use the power of the city , and then you can &apos;t have a whole bunch of other people , and then they were able to use a new call for a di@@ etary electro@@ chemical , a ste@@ wardship in the 1970s .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-98.097435): and I would like to give you a very interesting example of the world , to be able to put a picture of the world in the &apos; 50s , and the fact that the only way that the FBI has been able to do with their own an@@ kle .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-27.485081): but in all of these things , you can get into a prison , and you can &apos;t get rid of it .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-17.296030): but I &apos;m going to change it because it &apos;s the only way to create .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?

Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-9.822677): for 20 years , they &apos;re all right .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-44.135853): I think this is a little bit of a space that I have to do with , because I don &apos;t have any sense of being able to do .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-14.637214): I was just a few of them to do that .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-38.829529): this is the first time you &apos;re going to see a great moment in which you &apos;re going to hear , and I think it &apos;s a good thing .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-38.965652): so , in fact , I didn &apos;t think of a few words , because I was going to have to be in the &apos; 60s .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-33.451447): I &apos;m very excited , because I can tell you that there &apos;s a very much more important way in which I can .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-4.586545): it doesn &apos;t have any chance .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-22.515356): the very simple thing is that they &apos;re not going to be good for them .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-49.791309): the only thing that &apos;s going to be in your head is , because you &apos;re going to have to do anything , and I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.679721): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.362872): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-3.434385): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-10.262833): now , I don &apos;t think it was like this .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-16.913971): a visual , it &apos;s a very difficult way .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-18.675018): I mean , you &apos;ve got a completely different view of my head .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-13.894559): and this is a picture of someone who I had no vision .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-43.532761): I was very afraid of my father , and I was able to put a hand on my face and put me in a few weeks .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-75.946350): and by the way , I was able to use the same thing , and we have a little bit of a little bit of the brain , and it &apos;s not just about the way that we can do it .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-11.278982): and it &apos;s too difficult to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-9.308221): and I &apos;m standing on a stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-31.982300): I &apos;m in a little girl , and I &apos;m a little bit of the reason why I &apos;m a farmer .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-23.187271): I &apos;m going to ask the other question , but the people who are always trying to do this .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-6.323719): the second question is , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-18.166267): I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to be a lot of it . &quot;
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-44.738403): the second reason I &apos;m interested in is that the model of a global and a very powerful one , and it &apos;s a kind of thing .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-58.997749): we &apos;ve been working on the same thing , and we &apos;re not very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very powerful and powerful and natural selection .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-19.681652): this is an art for me , and it &apos;s a challenge for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-50.382793): I think there &apos;s some people who are in the world , and I think , &quot; Well , you know , there &apos;s a lot of tricks , and it &apos;s a pretty good sign . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-18.795717): and finally , you &apos;re looking at the core of the solution .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-105.175217): but I think that the only thing that you &apos;ve been doing is that there &apos;s a number of years , and it &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very simple , and that &apos;s where the next one has ever been done .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-36.433395): the next question I &apos;ve been saying is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to be a problem , you can &apos;t have a crisis ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.048445): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really have the opportunity to do this .
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-15.427864): but the other thing I want to do is , &quot; Well , what &apos;s the best one ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-5.094447): you know what you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-41.519234): you can &apos;t be the best version of the United States , and if you &apos;re in the middle of the car , you can &apos;t have a good idea .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-42.544426): and when I get to the whole one , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , no one is going to be the first one . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-49.867851): I don &apos;t want to be the best or the best one in the United States , and it &apos;s a company called &quot; The G@@ N@@ nor &quot; --
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-33.693161): and I want to say , &quot; Well , if you want to be able to get the right thing to do in the car .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-12.095858): you can &apos;t understand it , and it &apos;s not an incredible one .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-34.088844): now , I &apos;m going to show you the first time in the brain , because it &apos;s not just a lot of information .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-114.986343): and if you can see the camera , the camera is just a little bit of a mouse , and then you can see , and then he &apos;s going to go back to the front of the head , and then you can see , &quot; Well , the way that he &apos;s going to do , &quot; and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-1.685446): it looks like this .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-11.771910): in fact , it &apos;s just like a matter .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-7.594666): I was not sure that &apos;s what happened .
Predicted (-72.948624): and when you get to the money , you know , you &apos;re going to have a lot of money , and you &apos;re not going to have a good idea , because you &apos;re going to have a $ 20 @-@ year @-@ old version of the U.S. &quot;
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-23.362629): the question I &apos;m going to tell you is , &quot; Well , the whole one has been done ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-22.570726): so , they &apos;re just a little bit of the subject , but it &apos;s a little bit of the original .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-35.763237): this is the first one I had , and I was a picture that was done , and I didn &apos;t know that much before .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .

Ground Truth: and I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
Predicted (-11.395345): and I hope you &apos;ll see that there are some of my images .
Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-55.195408): they &apos;re a bunch of these tools and the ones that have been built , and they &apos;re not a team of artists , and they &apos;re all familiar with me .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-21.729687): so , the other thing I want to say is , &quot; What do you do for all the time ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-47.519176): I have a lot of time , and I don &apos;t know anything else , but I &apos;m going to get the lights in , and I can &apos;t get the same thing .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
Predicted (-37.418072): I was in a hospital , and I was a kid who was going to have to take me out of the money .
Ground Truth: when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
Predicted (-82.049942): when I was a friend of mine , I was a teenager , and I was a little bit of a pilot , and we would never have the right @-@ hand , and it &apos;s because it &apos;s a way that we can &apos;t get rid of the fire .
Ground Truth: and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
Predicted (-50.432175): I &apos;m going to work with this , and I don &apos;t have any sense of what the risk of , because it &apos;s a lot of money and a lot of their sex .
Ground Truth: I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
Predicted (-58.542656): I was in the middle of the U.K. , and they were born with a lot of food , and they &apos;re all the same , and they &apos;re probably the most expensive .
Ground Truth: and there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-37.975899): and it &apos;s about two million years ago , and the only way to be a mother , &quot; Why don &apos;t you see ? &quot;
Src: sondern : &quot; wie oft werde ich angehalten ? wann werde ich angehalten ? &quot;
Ground Truth: but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-15.504483): &quot; I &apos;m always asking , &quot; How do I get there ?
Ground Truth: when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
Predicted (-63.431938): I started to think about this , and the third reason that the number of women in India , is that they &apos;re not going to have a chance of getting their own cancer .
Src: die letzte Frage an mich lautet : &quot; wie ist es , ein Model zu sein ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
Predicted (-13.512903): the second question I &apos;m asking is , &quot; What is the phenomenon ?
Ground Truth: and I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ nier and you have sh@@ in@@ ier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
Predicted (-41.700920): and I think you &apos;re going to have a little bit of a good word , and you &apos;ll have a good life , and they &apos;re very excited .
Src: und back@@ stage geben wir eine Antwort , die vielleicht diesen Eindruck vermittelt .
Ground Truth: and when we &apos;re back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
Predicted (-15.315253): and we &apos;ll give a chance of taking this message .
Src: wir sagen : &quot; es ist wirklich toll , so viel zu reisen , und es ist toll , mit kreativen , inspirierten , leidenschaft@@ lichen Menschen zu arbeiten &quot; .
Ground Truth: we say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
Predicted (-40.139408): &quot; we &apos;re very happy to be , and it &apos;s a great thing to do with the arts , and it &apos;s very difficult to do .
Ground Truth: and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
Predicted (-43.686401): it &apos;s all the time that we have to tell you , because I &apos;m not sure that the camera is all the time , and I said , &quot; It &apos;s a picture . &quot;
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
Predicted (-18.195955): and I feel so much about it , because I have a chance to talk about it .

Ground Truth: extraordinary .

Predicted (-55.840752): but I have to go through the context of the wisdom and the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I think , is that people have to be able to do with them .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .

Predicted (-48.949539): and if we &apos;re not the only human being , it &apos;s a gift that we have , and it &apos;s a gift that has been made by a great definition of happiness .

Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-60.539112): so , you know , it &apos;s a very simple idea of how much energy you put in the air , but if you have a little bit of the energy that you &apos;ve got to do in this room .

Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-57.943687): and the surface of the air is the most important thing that you see in the background , and the one that &apos;s going to be in a few months .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-50.666439): if you take a little bit of the genome , and then you &apos;ll see the same thing that we &apos;ve got to do , and then you &apos;ll have to do this for 10 minutes .

Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-42.360653): I would like to see this object , because the sound of a star , the sky is a kind of a symbol of the universe .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-55.539322): but if you look at the same time , you &apos;ll see that the red line is going to be a little bit of the blood , and it &apos;s not going to be thrown away .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-40.504677): why is this ? and the light that &apos;s going to be in the case , and it &apos;s a little bit of the back .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-51.523586): so , in the lab , if you &apos;re in a car , you can actually get a little bit of the device that &apos;s going to be able to be able to get rid of it .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-11.691963): so , what &apos;s the first camera I &apos;ve done ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-51.877003): so , as you &apos;re looking at a little bit of a big , tiny , tiny , long @-@ term , but if you &apos;re going to have a new idea of what you &apos;re doing .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-85.844139): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of paper , and we &apos;ll put it on a little bit of a simple , and we &apos;ll try to figure out what the data is , and I &apos;m going to do this in the process of having a few years .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.962372): and we can do this with all sorts of data , and we &apos;ll really have a good example .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-8.640283): so , you can get rid of it .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-35.522018): and other things can be made by a way , but if you can create a new kind of ec@@ lip@@ se ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-14.553977): the idea is that we &apos;re going to make a light in the sky .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-48.376762): and it &apos;s going to be able to put a window back into the window , and then we &apos;ll get the light that &apos;s going to be the first time .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-7.517550): and this is not a technology that we &apos;ve seen .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-8.467009): on the left , we &apos;re using the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-24.928810): the window is the window that we &apos;re going to be able to pull out of the wall .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-52.096455): when the printing press was published , they were made by a new version of the &quot; This is actually made by the time . &quot;
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-106.103348): and we &apos;re going to put this light into the window , and this is the light that &apos;s going to be able to get a little bit of the light , and then we &apos;ll be able to put it back into the next few minutes , and then the only one that &apos;s going to be able to see the most important thing .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-23.372105): and because we have the camera , which is a very powerful camera , which is the ability of all .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-17.942665): it &apos;s a great time in your mind , and you can see it in the same way .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-41.439037): and we also have to understand the space , but the fact that we &apos;re not going to know about the light of the day .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-86.007637): if we can take a camera , we can see the camera , and we can see it in the same way , and we can see that it &apos;s all about the time , and we can see that the light bulb , and it &apos;s a little bit of the universe .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-2.629488): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-5.354550): so this is our website .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-106.492844): we &apos;ve got to do this , and we &apos;re able to see that the way we &apos;re going to see the air in the air , and we &apos;re able to use the air , and we &apos;re able to see the actual actual temperature of the air , which is the same thing that we can do in the air .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-75.547592): but the only way to do this is to be a very complex , and this is the first time that we &apos;re using a new language of the Internet , which is a very sophisticated example of what I &apos;m going to do .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-135.045929): so , as a result of the idea , we &apos;ve been able to do a new idea of the universe , and we &apos;ve never seen a few of the things that are now , and it &apos;s a very simple idea of the universe , which is a lot of time , and that &apos;s a lot of time , and we &apos;re not going to have a lot of time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-10.267828): but it &apos;s something that &apos;s really interesting .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-37.709595): if you look at the surface of the sky , you &apos;ll see that the wave of the ice is going to be .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-15.183849): the walls are going to be able to move .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-1.425606): what happens ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-36.319107): we realized that it would be a very complex , and we had a sense of the temperature of the Sun .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-72.031639): the universe is changing , and in the same way , the way we &apos;re doing is to put the same information in the air , and you can see that it &apos;s going to be in a way .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-110.271652): and if we &apos;re not going to be able to use the idea of the digital technology , the digital , the digital , the digital , the ideas that we &apos;ve been able to do , and the time that we have to go back to the past , and we have to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-5.067488): it &apos;s time to show you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-16.182329): there are many ways of changing our lives , how to fix it .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-29.640247): we don &apos;t have any chance to go through the street , and we don &apos;t have any of these people .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .

Ground Truth: how can we l@@ end and borrow more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
Predicted (-12.949511): how can we make more and more information ?
Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-16.921486): how do we learn from the physical world and the physical community ?
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-23.884371): how can we create our own dreams , and how are we going to be able to live our lives ?

Ground Truth: I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a ni@@ cer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
Predicted (-41.879803): I &apos;ve been able to see a piece of paper , and I &apos;ve got to think that this is a way that I can do it .

Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-15.032451): so , I &apos;m going to try to do this in my case .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-6.757698): it &apos;s a common relationship .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-34.298920): we &apos;re actually a little bit of <blank> als , and you &apos;re at the center of the piano .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-48.745689): so , a vast amount of resilience , and it has a very powerful vision of the brain , and it &apos;s a very important component .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-53.019787): so , of course , the ability to do with a very powerful human being , is to have a very specific impact on her own .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-11.523493): and many of you have been working on the research .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-86.017395): there are about a million people who have been living in the same way , and they have a chance to do something , and then the value of the disease , and the ability to treat it , not to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-50.436623): we need to do this , and if we have a good idea , it &apos;s a very important question , then we can &apos;t have to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-64.162819): and it &apos;s not a good example of what you have to do , and if you have a brain , you can &apos;t have a number of neurons that &apos;s been done in this case .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-37.205299): you have to take a product , and it &apos;s not going to be done , and it &apos;s actually a product that &apos;s already done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-9.827657): but what if the patient was going to do with this ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-32.032303): it would be a car that would take a job , and then get rid of your patients .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-18.536224): it was a hospital that was not allowed to do .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-23.443209): it &apos;s actually a cost of using a drug to do it .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-47.186298): so I want to use this to make a sense of what we &apos;re doing , which is , in fact , is to be a very simple example of the human race .

Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-8.192158): here &apos;s a video of the dolphin .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-83.353218): and if the human being is a little bit of a human , we can take it , and we &apos;ll have to put it in the wrong direction , because we have a chance of having a baby .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.484505): and as a result , it has a huge amount of training .

Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-56.930511): and the muscles can be placed in the mirror , and the muscles are just like the heart of the body , and the one that we can see .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-27.187504): in the middle , you can see a very simple , very high @-@ resolution .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-4.784374): we see the same symptoms .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-15.798624): the heart , the mood , etc .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-31.175549): and the ability to see a memory of the patient is still a lot of fun .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-149.425232): so the information can be done with this technology , and the software is actually a very simple , but if you can &apos;t have a lot of information , you can see that the brain is still in the middle of the class , and it &apos;s a very high @-@ tech , and it &apos;s a very high @-@ tech , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to use .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-40.815331): so , you can &apos;t use the same test , and if you &apos;re not a clinical test , it &apos;s very high .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-9.133481): and of course , there &apos;s a lot of infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.350946): you need to have no new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-12.763008): and the results are not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-10.295077): so you can actually get the results .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-14.265437): they &apos;re very simple , and you &apos;ll get 30 years .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-10.995378): they &apos;re just a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-21.024422): if you can actually make a lot of it , it &apos;s very difficult to use .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-9.885050): and this is what we can do with this .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-13.900982): we can use the same treatment for us .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-18.497997): the patients have no idea of using a drug .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-19.150391): we can measure the data of an amazing ability .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-31.170429): we can use a massive number of studies , and we &apos;ve been able to test the impact of the genome .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-25.365879): so we &apos;ve been able to do the same thing for a year to treat it .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-25.362873): so we &apos;re going to do the next step , and we &apos;re going to create the first one .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-55.092125): and with a few of them , we have a number of questions that are going to be able to do this , and we have to do the same thing .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-20.405844): we &apos;ve got a little bit of the planet , which is a number of people .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-54.611229): without having a cure , we can &apos;t use a single @-@ str@@ anded device for six years , and I &apos;ll just tell you that it &apos;s a big deal .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.042891): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-26.914381): when you start to see , we &apos;re going to kill people , and if you don &apos;t know what ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-7.773045): what do you do with all of these guys ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-37.162735): what happens is that the patient &apos;s brain is going to be able to get rid of it , and when you &apos;re not paying attention .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-10.603087): you can &apos;t even see the end of it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-59.967926): so we &apos;re using this kind of a very specific component , which is that it &apos;s very important to understand what we &apos;re doing , because of those things are being made .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-17.625008): now , in fact , has its highest frequency ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.325431): it &apos;s better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-65.479874): my friend has been working on this , and I think it &apos;s just a fantastic idea that we &apos;ve been able to do this , because there &apos;s a number of things that are going to be done in the world .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-5.251674): I call it a value .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-63.393375): this is the question : you can take the phone and put the drugs into the doctor , and you can see how the money would be made by the people who have to do with the drugs .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-3.918061): it &apos;s exactly .
Src: vielen Dank . Max Little , meine Damen und Herren !
Ground Truth: thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Predicted (-2.047225): thank you .
Src: danke , Tom .
Ground Truth: thanks , Tom .
Predicted (-0.337818): thank you .
Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-21.260872): I &apos;m here in the middle of India , and I &apos;m working on the largest island .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-31.193356): and the background is the one that I &apos;m going to see in the water of the United States .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-43.182087): the south is a very efficient way to see the forest , because we can see the same as the Amazon .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-27.143213): the males , they &apos;re the ones who do it , and they &apos;re going to see .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-2.738752): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-35.089386): this is the one that we had died in the winter , and I was very scared of it , because it was a little .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-51.246101): the god of the river , and we said that we have a lot of our bodies , and the way we see it is that we &apos;re living .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-13.206633): when I was a teenager , I was afraid to do it .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-36.814903): the fight and our enemy , they &apos;re going to protect us from the fact that we &apos;re going to survive .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-5.609021): and they kill the elephants .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-15.493656): here &apos;s a woman who was born with no eggs .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-30.347719): and I think it &apos;s also a very , very , very , very , of course , in the United States .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-32.410683): my mother was in a car , and it was about five years of being killed by the way .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.056854): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-13.635812): my first was a natural man to kill .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-25.806976): but it was really hard to convince us that the police could not be able to do this .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-5.686844): but I didn &apos;t have any money .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-19.265488): one thing I wanted to do was I had a picture of a gun .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-20.160580): I wanted to know that the victims were going to be a sheep .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-6.900637): but spiders are very difficult .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-48.365993): you &apos;ll see the ball , and they go back and see the same thing , and they &apos;re going to be , &quot; Well , you know , that &apos;s not going to happen .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-7.836686): and they &apos;re going to kill us .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-44.146328): I was in a room for a while , and I was walking around the boat , and I was able to kill the birds .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-14.844953): the nose starts to break .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.121807): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-45.625519): so , when I was a little kid , I was working on the whole room , and I had to tell you that it was just a little bit of my life .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-44.855076): I took a little bit of a battery , and it &apos;s a little bit of a stick that you can see when it comes from .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-14.244127): and I had a switch to the lights and the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-17.968054): this is a little girl who &apos;s made of a hand@@ bag .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-6.261721): and then I got this together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-34.035446): the electricity industry is going to take a battery on the roof , and it &apos;s a piece of fuel .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-15.224185): and the whole thing is called <blank> tic .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-22.032440): you can see the waves of the Gulf because they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-8.884880): and this is what happens when you get to the queen .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-32.914223): the lights and the flowers , I think , are the only way to put it in the air .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.042891): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-18.927326): so I was working on this , and we had no chance to deal with them .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-8.086724): and then we were wondering ,
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-3.918771): one of them was a woman .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-23.572870): she had no chance of eating their clothes , and I saw them in my face .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.708845): and I said , &quot; Yeah .
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-13.900869): I &apos;m going to see the lights in the background .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-31.875435): I &apos;ve spent the most of the houses in the house , and it &apos;s very easy to use them .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-65.156944): this is a way to use my own species , because of the birds , the elephants , the main ones are also to be able to go to the ground .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
Predicted (-46.455677): my job , I was a very proud of a company in India , and I &apos;m really excited about the work of the United States .
Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-19.337996): my work is about teaching and training and training .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-47.518703): I have to go through the garden , and I have to see where we have all the way that we &apos;re going to go and do it .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-48.916527): so , one of the things I was in a hospital , and I was told that I was a man who was going to see me in my pocket .
Src: und hier stehe ich nun .
Ground Truth: and here I am today .
Predicted (-4.785368): and here I &apos;m going to see .
Ground Truth: I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
Predicted (-13.325089): I &apos;d run a plane for my first time ,
Ground Truth: so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
Predicted (-20.816135): so , when I &apos;m a designer , I &apos;m going to be a big fan of the project .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-55.704346): I was able to go through the clouds , and I could not see the power of the grass , but I was able to bring the face of the forest .
Predicted (-33.052006): so , in my own name , I &apos;m going to tell you that this is a real question .
Ground Truth: you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
Predicted (-7.537164): you don &apos;t know how much it &apos;s written .

Ground Truth: what &apos;s the next one on your list ?
Predicted (-3.139819): what &apos;s the next line ?
Ground Truth: my next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
Predicted (-22.605013): so , my first example is , I &apos;m going to use a technology on a plate .
Ground Truth: but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
Predicted (-19.968981): yes , I have no idea of the electric cars , but I &apos;ve got to know .
Src: du hast es bereits einmal versucht , nicht wahr - Ja , ich hab &apos; s schon mal versucht , aber den Versuch wieder aufgegeben , weil ich ... einen Schlag bekam .
Ground Truth: you already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .

Ground Truth: photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treas@@ ured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
Predicted (-47.427299): I have to be a camera , and I &apos;m not sure that I have a passion for the last time , because I &apos;m a little bit of my own voice .
Ground Truth: there were no art directors , no sty@@ lists , no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots , not even any regard for lighting .
Predicted (-45.060444): there was no idea of a single @-@ scale , no one that had to do , not have to go through the screen .
Ground Truth: in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
Predicted (-21.768425): by the way , the most difficult thing to be heard from the north .
Ground Truth: my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7th and 5@@ th .
Predicted (-56.457428): and I was a picture of my first friend , and I was in my head , and I was asked to tell you that this is a big picture of the size of the morning .
Ground Truth: we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Predicted (-31.301029): so , in fact , we were just a few minutes , and we were going to see this in the middle of the movie .
Ground Truth: well you can see where this is going .
Predicted (-9.199073): well , you can see , that &apos;s what happens .
Ground Truth: approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a father @-@ daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
Predicted (-61.341434): when my daughter was born , she said , &quot; My husband is a little girl , and I &apos;m not going to tell her , &quot; Why is it a school in the middle of my own journey ?
Src: damals fingen wir an , vorbei@@ laufende Touristen zu bitten , ein Bild von uns zu machen .
Ground Truth: this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
Predicted (-30.142214): so , after we were walking around , we would just like to find a picture .
Ground Truth: you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total stranger .
Predicted (-28.537350): you know , it &apos;s a very powerful way of seeing what it is when you &apos;re in a camera .
Ground Truth: no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Predicted (-29.869905): no one has ever been , and the one is not the only thing that we &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
Predicted (-19.815523): we didn &apos;t know how much this was going to be , and we started changing the world .
Src: diese Reise ist uns sehr heilig geworden .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
Predicted (-8.876202): this is a journey of extraordinary .
Ground Truth: this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five @-@ year @-@ old could understand .
Predicted (-34.558990): so this was going to be done by a month , and I found that there was something like this in the morning .
Src: diese Bilder sind viel mehr als nur ein fest@@ ge@@ halten@@ er Moment , oder eine bestimmte Reise .
Ground Truth: so these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
Predicted (-18.808403): these are a few times , and it &apos;s a very difficult way to read .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Predicted (-49.656647): we &apos;re a new way of doing it , and we &apos;re not going to spend time in the past , but we &apos;re starting to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mile@@ stones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
Predicted (-62.159885): because what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;re seeing in the same way , and it &apos;s very difficult to see how much time it &apos;s going to be , and we &apos;re going to see the world .
