Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-83.018539): now , the question is , if you look at the last step , the answer is that the only thing that we &apos;ve done is that the president of the country is a very powerful success , and it &apos;s not the case of their success .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-10.845319): that &apos;s not what our mothers do .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-80.994560): they &apos;re also very good at the point of view , and the reason is that they &apos;re not going to be a little bit more interested in the society , and in the case , in the case , the people are in the future .
Ground Truth: under the Taliban , girls who went to school num@@ bered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
Predicted (-33.703590): and the few months later , they were not going to be there , but the minister was too much .

Ground Truth: I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; with@@ dra@@ wal .
Predicted (-32.436523): I think that the amount of money is not going to be the decline of the people in the middle .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-55.792290): but when I go home , I &apos;m going to be in the school , and I &apos;m going to take a look at the work of my children , and they &apos;re going to be a bit more creative .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-44.368622): and I &apos;m a good reason for the country , and the rest of the world is to be a child who &apos;s dying .

Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Ground Truth: instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under Republican or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chief magi@@ strate , titles of respect@@ ability -- not bloody President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maje@@ sty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ularity , i@@ .@@ e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
Predicted (-188.801590): and after the first time , we would not be able to do it , but to say that the president of the world is not only about the political system , and the only way we can do it , and the political system is not going to be able to be able to do it in the &apos; 70s , and the West , and the West , and the &apos; 70s , and the most important thing is not to be the case of the case of the case .
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.131991): you can see a little bit of things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-43.579124): all right , I &apos;ve got to say , I &apos;ve got the best chance to do this -- not even before the last one in the world .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-27.984596): the president of the Obama administration said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s only in the case .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-48.390385): if you think that you can get a new one , then you &apos;ll never be able to do it , and then again , that &apos;s a very successful case .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-41.726345): and the final thing is that the most important thing is , is that the last thing you have in America is not about the same thing , right ?
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-59.094296): and the thing that you have to do is to take a million of the world , and the most advanced industry is going to be the most efficient and the world .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-13.058119): and the story is , the shape of the universe .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-7.852033): and this is the same thing .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-7.247342): they have a great deal .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-24.969528): and the other side of the world is the one that &apos;s been trained , as I did .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.477667): but how do you know that a single country ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-4.767913): AB : 14 .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-30.685097): because you &apos;re just going to be the guy who &apos;s going to get out of the air .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-58.817482): and the first thing that he &apos;s lost is that if you &apos;re not in the United States , it &apos;s still a lawyer , and the only one that &apos;s going to be lost .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-21.974115): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with me , and I &apos;m going to take you through the project .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-40.934429): try to understand the words of reality , but the reality of the world is not just going to be more complex than any other way in the world .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.548745): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-89.984802): so I went to a little bit of a year @-@ old , and we went to the United States , and it was a very good @-@ looking @-@ old , terrible , serious , terrible , terrible , serious ,

Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-68.214012): I was a little bit of a p@@ ale , and I put a little bit of the box on the left , and he would have a completely different approach to the back .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.696200): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-325.249054): and I was a little bit more than a couple of years ago , and we had a lot of mis@@ sil@@ es , and I was able to go to the local and see the same thing , and we would go to the street , and we would have a relationship with the same kind of &quot; The New Yorker , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ us &quot; and &quot; with &quot; and &quot; Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ci@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ ri@@ cist , &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; in the &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; with &quot; with &quot; with &quot; and &quot; and &quot; and &quot; with &quot; and &quot; and &quot;
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-5.488446): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-72.580856): so I &apos;m here , the only one of the two @-@ year @-@ old and @-@ old co@@ ar@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ ans , who are in the United States , and I think it &apos;s a very powerful country .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-89.545670): but I &apos;m a lot of people who are trying to make sense of how to make it beautiful , and we can &apos;t do it in the world , and I think it &apos;s a lot of ways to make the difference between the art and the magic and the magic of the world .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-87.258324): I &apos;d like to take a new day , a new family of the world , and the great thing about &quot; mon@@ archy &quot; is to be a non @-@ governmental , &quot; and &quot; the mon@@ archy .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-57.914268): and if the government is going to be a business party , and I &apos;m going to take a vote for the campaign , and I &apos;m going to ask him , &quot; What &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-32.753090): and this is what they call to the use of the company to make it more accessible .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-118.956390): I &apos;m going to talk about the U.S. government , and the reason is to go to the local market is to take a look at the front of the police , and we &apos;re going to take a look at the money , and they &apos;re not going to be able to take a look at the local market and take a look at the front of the world .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-28.161837): I think that the question of what I &apos;m going to do is look at the conflict in the country .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-159.905350): and the people who are in the &apos; 80s , and the only way to do is to create a new kind of a local local park , and we can take a re@@ mov@@ al of the city , and then we could create a re@@ ce@@ ding and a new kind of a re@@ alist in the &apos; 80s , and the way that it &apos;s going to be a non @-@ governmental .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-138.798981): and I would like to take a look at the &quot; The O@@ de@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ g of the great con@@ fin@@ als of the country , and I think it &apos;s going to be able to take a look at the most powerful part of the world , to bring the power of the world to be able to be able to do this in the &apos; 70s .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-26.841160): but in those things , you can get to that point where you &apos;re going to be un@@ interrupted .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-15.609714): but I do it because I believe it &apos;s the only way to change .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-10.778831): that &apos;s my point . what is your lifestyle ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.028965): thank you .
Src: Hi . mein Name ist Cameron Russell und seit einiger Zeit arbeite ich als Model .
Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-24.020123): David is my name . and I &apos;m sure that &apos;s where I &apos;m a lot of time .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-10.183098): so , for 10 years , they did .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-47.242119): so I think this is a little bit of a room that would have been put into my own room , and I don &apos;t have to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-10.620872): and I &apos;m a little bit more involved .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-34.377609): this is the first time that you can see a moment in the world , and I &apos;ll be able to tell you how to do it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-39.387585): and I &apos;d be very good at this time , because I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;ve been going to read this article .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-33.968918): I think it &apos;s very clear that I can put in a few minutes , because I think that &apos;s going to be a little bit different .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-8.733645): and no one has to do it .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-18.787720): and the good thing is that they &apos;re not too good at it .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-57.110844): the only thing that &apos;s going to be in your head is , because if you &apos;re on the right , I &apos;m going to get to the other person , you &apos;re not going to do anything .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.247470): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.170928): so why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-8.260611): that was a very embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-12.431491): so , I don &apos;t know how much this was .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-14.150578): it &apos;s a powerful metaphor , but it &apos;s a very powerful picture .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.042921): I &apos;m sure that all of you have been in my pocket .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-15.197926): and this is a moment where I didn &apos;t even know any one .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-45.290928): I was very afraid to go and see my father , and I was looking at the same kind of guy who was sitting in my pocket .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-78.934639): and as the men and the other side of the room , I think , &quot; It &apos;s a little bit more than the rest of us , and I think it &apos;s a very simple way to do something that we can &apos;t do in the process . &quot;
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-19.770966): and to be honest , I &apos;m too happy to be in the way .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-13.518697): and I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , because I &apos;m a journalist .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-30.672981): I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , because I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s a hero .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-18.719513): I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be done on the other hand .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.739602): the first question is , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.753043): I said , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not true .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-59.985558): the second one is , I think , if you &apos;re a national and an economic model , it &apos;s a very important thing to be a little bit more interested in how to be .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-79.793198): now , in the same way , we &apos;ve been working with a wonderful and wonderful thing , and we &apos;re not just a very strong , very strong , fragile and fragile , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-18.260609): and this is an architect , and it &apos;s worth me with it .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-77.829201): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit like this , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m sure , &quot; -- you know , the guy &apos;s going to have a lot of h@@ ells .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-17.514610): and the first thing I do is you know , very simple .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-106.094933): but I &apos;m sure that the project is a single @-@ scale , and it &apos;s a very , very clear @-@ scale , and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got a little bit of the number of people who have been left , and they &apos;ve never seen it .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-23.109013): the next question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to be a single one ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.564726): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t believe that I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-16.247372): so the other part of the question is , &quot; Well , I want to give you a little bit of that ? &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.804097): you know what ? you can do .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-54.166508): you know , if you &apos;re going to be the best @-@ selling car or the American dream , or the next one , you can &apos;t be a big deal .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-52.193192): and then , if you &apos;re all going to be a little bit wrong , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , I &apos;m going to say , no , no , no , I &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-61.558800): I don &apos;t want to be the best or the best selling or the English @-@ selling book , and the answer is , &quot; The New Yorker is a little bit more pi@@ cky . &quot;
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-43.775204): and you &apos;ll say , if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the wrong thing , you &apos;re going to be able to get the word .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-14.593486): you can &apos;t understand it , and it &apos;s not the case of your life .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-41.155842): I &apos;m going to show you a lot of data that &apos;s going to be able to do this in the future , because it &apos;s not just as much as possible .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-117.976074): and if you look at this guy , you can see the camera , and you can see the front of the boat , and then you can see the front line , and then you go back to the back , and he &apos;s going to go back to the front , and you can see , &quot; Oh , my God , here &apos;s a little bit of the time . &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-2.553467): it looks like this .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-14.180205): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-5.430561): I didn &apos;t know what this is .
Predicted (-83.230568): and if you get a lot of money , you &apos;ll have a better job , and you &apos;ll never see the money , but if you &apos;re going to go back to the &apos; 80s , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s no more money in the U.S. , you can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-12.811286): the question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Is this ever possible ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-34.186626): but the other ones are just a little bit of a few , and it &apos;s just a little bit of the end .

Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-18.041224): now , the other people say , &quot; Is it going to be good for me ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-68.706406): I have a few hundred or six , I &apos;m not going to be able to get the most efficient , and I think , &quot; I can &apos;t get any of those things that are going to be used to do .

Predicted (-49.150906): it &apos;s a little girl in the world , and it &apos;s not just about eight million dollars , but the next one is , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;

Ground Truth: and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
Predicted (-53.471428): it &apos;s all the same thing that we &apos;ve seen , because I &apos;m not sure what the whole thing you &apos;ve ever heard about is , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; because I &apos;m not sure .

Predicted (-62.535355): and if you have a little bit of the t@@ wo@@ ve , they &apos;re the most expensive and the ones that have been made out of the same , and they &apos;re the most beautiful ones .
Ground Truth: so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
Predicted (-103.839012): and I thought that I &apos;d come to this work , and I &apos;m going to be very clear to me , because I &apos;m very sure that I &apos;m going to be able to do this , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do something that was a very good thing to do with the same thing .
Ground Truth: but mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a legacy of gender and racial oppres@@ sion when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fici@@ aries .
Predicted (-42.322704): it was a very difficult thing to be a great deal with my heart , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to speak .
Ground Truth: but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
Predicted (-97.722412): I &apos;m sure I can &apos;t know how many years of being done , and I &apos;ve been able to do this , and I &apos;ve been able to say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got a chance to be able to do this , and I &apos;ve never seen it , and I &apos;ve been able to do this for 10 years .
Ground Truth: if there &apos;s a tak@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowle@@ dging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Predicted (-46.842415): if you come to this talk , you &apos;ll just get a little bit of the argument that we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of all the money .

Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-58.079132): but I want to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I love to do with , is to be a sense of trust .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-38.692127): so the perception of the brain is that we can &apos;t see a lot of other people , and it &apos;s a bit more important .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-13.718667): it &apos;s just one way to say that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-42.740761): and I &apos;d like to say that if you &apos;re a friend and I can &apos;t be able to do something , and then it &apos;s too easy to do it .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-10.131564): you can be a very powerful way .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-61.805397): because , if you &apos;re not a single one , we &apos;re all born , and we &apos;re all part of the story -- that &apos;s a gift that has a gift to us .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-37.472137): the amount of life in the world is going to be done in a way that we can go back and see what &apos;s going on .
Src: bitte - sagen Sie mir nicht , dass ich normal bin .
Ground Truth: please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Predicted (-12.683685): so , I say , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.168645): thank you .
Ground Truth: Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet p@@ ier@@ cing through an apple , and exposure just a million@@ th of a second .
Predicted (-82.609131): and he was doing a film with a long @-@ term sequence , and he was able to take a piece of a piece of a piece of a p@@ ale , and a half @-@ pound cylinder .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-38.913353): but the next time we &apos;re going to see a billion years , and a half a million people are not going to be a single step in the world .
Src: ich stelle Ihnen eine neue Art der Fotografie vor , die F@@ em@@ to @-@ Fotografie , eine neue Ab@@ bild@@ ungste@@ chnik , die so schnell ist , dass sie Zeit@@ lu@@ pen@@ aufnahmen von Licht in Bewegung erstellen kann .
Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-66.598305): I &apos;m going to show you a new kind of design that &apos;s used in a series of new ways of making the machine @-@ generated , and it &apos;s a whole series of materials that are actually being used .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-57.847404): so we can go through the camera and see the lights on the screen , and we can &apos;t see our own little bit of the space in the sky , and see what &apos;s going on ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-120.843658): so if I can take a little bit of a magnetic field , I &apos;ll take a picture of a few seconds -- and it &apos;s a very simple , very short @-@ term , and it &apos;s called the electron , and the energy that &apos;s going to be able to be able to get a little bit more than a single electron .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-51.285782): so if you take this kind of a bottle of energy , you &apos;ll get this little bit of a bottle that would be used in the last 20 years .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-10.200709): how does it look like a light bulb ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-4.330820): so , this whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-87.015656): but the short sound is that if you take a little bit of a long time , you can see the amount of energy that we &apos;ve made in this room -- and you can see that this little bit of a few minutes , and then you can see the same thing .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-19.452934): no , no , the marketing company is not going to do this .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-19.928604): so , this is a little bit of a lot of time , and I &apos;m going to show you what happens .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-65.775543): the third one of the first pieces of this is called a plastic , and then it &apos;s going to be put into the air , and then we put it into a piece of paper .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-29.741369): and in a sense , you get to the bottom of the room , and you see the heat of the ground .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-33.661011): and the most expensive thing is that they can put a lot of time and put it in the back .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-16.468552): and you can see that the camera is in the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-58.143139): and the winds are moving from the surface of the air , and the parts are very close to the end of the line , because you &apos;re not in the room .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-61.431831): so if you take a picture of the same thing , you &apos;ll see the same thing that &apos;s going to take a 10 @-@ year @-@ old and then take a look at the same time , and then you can see what &apos;s going on ?
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-6.942590): a day , no one , a year .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-37.029327): it &apos;s a very difficult thing -- a little bit of a little bit of a p@@ ung@@ ed , in the middle .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-10.946581): and how does it be a little bit of plastic ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-25.066242): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air , and the color of the street .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-12.764849): it &apos;s like if you put a stone in a rock .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-47.664318): I would like to say that this is a kind of a picture of a human , and it &apos;s a kind of a kind of invisible object .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-54.714817): but if you look at the blue box , you &apos;ll see that the red line is still alive , they &apos;re not going to be able to get a little bit of the material .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-57.676262): why is this ? and the squid is in the case , and it &apos;s a little bit of the back , and it &apos;s going to be a piece of paper that &apos;s coming back .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-62.837715): so , in the next phase , if you &apos;re in a new way , you can actually be able to get a car in the center , and you can actually be able to get a camera in the backyard .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-10.642738): so what &apos;s the camera that I &apos;ve been working on ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-79.413010): so , if you look at a long time , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a long @-@ term , but if you &apos;re in the first few years , you can &apos;t get a little bit more efficient , you can see that it &apos;s a little bit more complicated than the Earth .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-91.908829): so we &apos;re going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;m going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to try to make this very simple , very quickly , and we &apos;re going to have this new set of war@@ p .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.327991): and we can put all this stuff on the right and make some pretty interesting things .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-16.061781): so , the name is going to be done .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-37.168659): and how do you think that there are other creatures that can be a great new way to make a living dream ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.025206): the idea is that we can make light from the door .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-57.600525): it &apos;s going to be coming back to the center , and then we &apos;re going to go back to the center of the room , and then the whole piece of the air is coming back .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-11.634978): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve just seen it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-10.091278): on the left , we &apos;re going to get the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-26.284374): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to take the camera out of the window .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-40.322639): the first thing we had was called &quot; The Ori@@ gin of Spe@@ cies , &quot; and it was made by a lot of different shapes .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-145.690292): so we can take this light and put it into the window , and then you &apos;ll get a little bit of the wind , and the light will be able to get a little bit of the wind , and then you can see that the light will be made in a very short part of the entire universe , and then we &apos;re going to have to be able to get a little bit more of the power .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-27.789364): and when we get to the camera , it &apos;s a very big camera that &apos;s all the tools .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.118446): it &apos;s a great way to do it in the world and see the same thing .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-49.129715): but the way we do it is to the point of view , because we don &apos;t know how to do it , but we &apos;re not able to see the same thing .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-106.551743): if we can take a camera , we can take a camera , and see the light of the camera -- and we can see that , if you can see the same piece of light , and then we can actually see the same thing , and I can actually understand how we &apos;re going to do this stuff .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-3.068006): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.354622): so this is the actual app .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-147.050125): we can see that we can see in the process of the first time we can see the air , and we can see the first step in the air , and we can see where we can actually go back and see the air that we can see in the air , and we can put them in the next few months , and we can see the way we can see the future of the world .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-76.627808): but it &apos;s also the key part of the problem , which is that this is a little bit more important than the technology of the project , and I &apos;m going to be able to talk about a new kind of a new field of engineering .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-148.183456): so , as a scientist , the science of science , is a whole lot of science , and I &apos;m going to show you that we can &apos;t see the whole collection of the universe , and we can actually see a few seconds of the universe , which is a lot of fun with the technology that we can do with this new , and then we can &apos;t have a whole whole lot of time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-8.172329): but it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-21.348106): if you look at these waves , you can see the waves coming from the road .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-11.219862): the things that we can go to .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-3.118641): what &apos;s going on ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-39.106102): and it &apos;s been that we could put a lot of light in the early universe , and I thought , pretty much of this .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-79.597992): the point is that the universe is in the world , and the way you put in the room is to make a difference , and then we can put the same kind of a lot of information in the back .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-130.765366): so , if you can &apos;t be able to take the idea of the new world , and we &apos;ve been able to take the idea of the new ideas , and we &apos;ve been able to do that in our own book , and we &apos;ve got to be able to take off the back of the world , and we &apos;ve got to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-4.600838): it &apos;s time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-6.365660): there are many ways of helping our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-29.807476): we don &apos;t have any side of the street , but we don &apos;t have to be able to do the same thing .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .

Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-22.654579): how do we take away from the urban and the buildings that we can make .
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?

Ground Truth: her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
Predicted (-26.706648): she was a woman who was in her mother , and she was like she was a shock .
Ground Truth: and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .

Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-38.594826): I don &apos;t know if I was a little bit of the crash , and it was the same thing that you could walk around .

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s ca@@ val@@ ry . &quot;
Predicted (-13.873255): &quot; well , I &apos;d like to be a dog . &quot;
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Predicted (-13.005397): &quot; well , I &apos;m going to be able to do myself . &quot;
Ground Truth: so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
Predicted (-41.969284): and this was a place where I had to be able to do the joy and the joy of the people who were in the back and forth .
Src: es geht darum zu wissen , dass man nicht allein ist .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
Predicted (-8.977034): it &apos;s about the point that you don &apos;t know .
Src: es geht darum , unsere Nachbarn zu verstehen und zwar auf eine neue und auf@@ schluss@@ reiche Art und Weise .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enli@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
Predicted (-24.558109): it &apos;s about our relationship to the city and the way we get a little bit of it .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
Predicted (-38.819828): it &apos;s about the way that we think about and how we do it , and it &apos;s important to be the way we think about ourselves .
Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-100.367683): I &apos;ve got this story , and I &apos;ve got a few years ago , and I &apos;ve got this idea that we &apos;ve got a lot of people in the United States , and we &apos;ve got to go to the East and create a building of the world , and we &apos;re going to use this open @-@ source software .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-46.187744): we have the opportunity to do our own lives , and we have to have a lot of choices that we have to be connected to our citizens .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-18.724922): the other one is the most important thing we have to do is to change the lives of people .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-45.826492): there &apos;s a lot of time in the brain , and the more important thing to do is to be able to look at the same time , and to think about what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-49.175163): we &apos;re always talking about it , and I think that &apos;s not just about the end of the day , but we &apos;re going to be able to talk about the disease .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-12.967983): the conclusion of life is that we think about .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-75.261581): the challenges of our lives are more vulnerable to us , and to help us to create a better world , and to help people to live in the world , and we hope that we can help ourselves more and more and more of them .

Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.168645): thank you .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.168645): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-42.434475): so I &apos;m a little bit more interested in the question that we &apos;re doing with is to be a social scientist , which is a key thing .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-6.657619): no , we know what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-14.320362): so I &apos;m going to talk to you today , which is why I &apos;m doing it .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-10.326591): it &apos;s a tough place in the face .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-53.345772): we &apos;re just a little bit of the dance of the B@@ ic@@ ic@@ os@@ y , and we &apos;re just looking at them .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-60.131096): so , in a very powerful , sophisticated , sophisticated , and a whole set of skills that we have to do is to have a certain kind of unique property .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-65.246521): so , in fact , the most powerful thing that we &apos;ve done is that it &apos;s been a little bit of a living in my life -- it &apos;s a great thing to do with him .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-13.027047): and so many of you have been working on this technology .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-96.329254): there are millions of people who are dying in the world , and yet , in the same age , we have a tremendous amount of disease , and they have a chance to do something about the same thing that we can do , and that &apos;s not going to be able to get the disease .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-72.355911): so we have to do this , and we have to have a sense of the right thing , if we have a problem , it &apos;s a good thing to do it , and that &apos;s the case of what we can do .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-66.740753): and it &apos;s not a good thing , but if you have a lot of brain @-@ related therapy , you can &apos;t see that there &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a drug that &apos;s in the brain .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-33.400517): you can &apos;t do it , and you have to do it , and it &apos;s not just a few months ago .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-12.708779): but what if we had to do with the patient &apos;s brain ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-31.250816): and I would be able to take a car out of the hospital , and get a lot better .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-29.120161): it was not a hospital @-@ to @-@ be @-@ to @-@ be @-@ to @-@ do @-@ work .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-18.748978): it &apos;s so much to be able to do that in the U.S.
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-44.622452): so I &apos;m going to try to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do something in the most efficient way , because we &apos;re all familiar with this kind of thing .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-11.917855): so here &apos;s a video of the pin@@ wheel .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-107.130219): and if the sound is a little bit like this , we can put a little bit of a human , and we can put it in the wrong way , and we have to do that , if we have a lot of respect to the skin , we can give them a little bit of the word .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.855271): and as a result , it &apos;s a tremendous amount of training .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-10.614227): remember , when you learn how to live .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-49.584656): and the sound that you can see is the control of the skin , and the muscles are re@@ treated as well as the one that we can see .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-30.916714): and in the same way , you can see a little bit of a single @-@ hand side .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.793507): we see the same thing .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-14.717701): the cl@@ oning is the age of voice .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-31.461845): and the body is a bit more nuanced and it &apos;s a bit of the case .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-146.414108): so this can be the same , and the ability to read through a lot of information , and that &apos;s why we can read a lot of software , and yet , in fact , that &apos;s a new memory , and it &apos;s not just a single single child , but it &apos;s a very powerful system that &apos;s going to be able to have a lot of time .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-39.142937): so , if you &apos;re using these tests , you can &apos;t have any better answer , but they &apos;re pretty good at the same test .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-8.846689): so , it &apos;s very important .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.607718): you don &apos;t have to build a new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-9.250924): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-9.389424): so you can see the whole thing .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-12.239216): they &apos;re very , very quickly , again , 30 seconds .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-13.182807): they &apos;re very cheap , and we &apos;re going to see what &apos;s called this .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-18.360563): if you &apos;re a very efficient way , it &apos;s really a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-10.793493): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-14.211793): we can do this with severe risk .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-18.847878): no data can be done before the patient &apos;s license .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-13.617197): we can move through a completely different paradigm .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-39.206291): we can take a long @-@ term genome , and we &apos;ve been able to do the same thing that we &apos;ve done in the first time .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-24.075752): so we &apos;ve been able to take the evidence for the first time to get rid of it .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-37.147293): so let &apos;s take the first step in this project , and we &apos;re going to be able to do this in the first @-@ term .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-64.083336): and so , for example , we have a number of children who are using a full @-@ scale , and we have to do this with the same number of un@@ informed data .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-21.352463): we &apos;ve got a little bit of the two @-@ thirds of the planet .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-69.651505): and if you can get a little bit of a friend , you can &apos;t have any extra time , and we &apos;ll have to be able to get a few minutes from the end of the year .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.168645): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-34.797543): if you take the medicines , we &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , how do you get sick and you have to eat them ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.965558): what do you do with all of these little bits ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-38.226154): the problem is that when you get to the patient &apos;s brain , you know , it &apos;s not a doctor , it &apos;s a mistake .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-8.101163): you can &apos;t even think of it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-72.292984): but there &apos;s a lot of information that we &apos;re doing , and this is a very important thing to do , because these are the key things that we call , which is that we &apos;re doing , in fact , are a very important thing .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-15.028001): now , how does it have any lower income ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.114227): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-79.961716): my boss , I &apos;ve been able to do this , because it &apos;s a fantastic idea that we can do it , and it &apos;s been done by the way that we &apos;ve done this in the world , and it &apos;s a tremendous amount of data .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-6.894819): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-83.907166): this is the question that you can take -- and you can send the phone to the person who can do with your iPhone , and then you can get the phone , and then you can get the phone to the doctor &apos;s call it .
Src: genau .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-9.692459): I &apos;m here in the middle of Brazil .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.030243): and the background is the most li@@ d in the woods .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-52.915840): the south is the same thing that we &apos;re doing in the south of the Amazon , and it &apos;s a very , very easy way to do the same thing .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-21.037153): the males , the females , and they are the ones that we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-4.511889): they kill our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-38.623962): this is the morning , I was a dead accident , and I was in the morning , and it was a terrible thing .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-54.676208): the god of mine , the elephant and the elephant , and the one that we &apos;ve been looking at is that we &apos;re living with the plants and the other .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-11.764478): and as a child , I was afraid to speak .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-27.805683): the protect our mother , and they &apos;re the root of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.424741): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-15.486729): here &apos;s a man who was killed in the northern hemisphere .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-31.177788): and I think that there &apos;s a lot of conservation in the forest -- even though there &apos;s a lot of sharks .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-27.873316): my mother is a man who &apos;s in the forest , and he died with me .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.217278): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.859644): my first idea was to kill fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-22.293547): but I realized that there was no way to help us to get rid of the street .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.692779): but I didn &apos;t go .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-19.575832): I was a second person . I thought I could do it with a bird .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-29.453812): I thought that I would be the only dog to go out and get rid of the sheep .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-5.897057): but the lions are very difficult .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-37.668110): you &apos;ll see the car coming up , and they &apos;re going to be there , and they &apos;re going to see the same thing .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-7.972783): and they fight and fight .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-41.929039): I was walking in a couple of days , and I was walking through the boat , and I was able to take a gun .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-15.373835): the elephant is not moving .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.509208): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-58.176918): so , I was a little bit of a little bit of the day , and I was walking around the city , and I was able to see that I had a little bit of my life .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-48.186203): I took a little bit of a battery , and you can see a little bit of a car , and you can see it in the right direction .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-18.829580): and I thought I had to get a signal out of the lights and the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-18.605404): this is a little girl who &apos;s not a piece of paper .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-6.115904): and then I built this whole .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-36.153084): this is the energy that we can take the battery and put it on a roof @-@ scale device .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-16.982658): and the big thing is a little bit of the subject .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-25.056709): you know , the stories are coming out of the mountains , because they &apos;re going to be there .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-9.355927): and this is how the lions are .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-37.226128): the color of the lights , and I &apos;m sure that the hell is going to be on the end of the night .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .

Ground Truth: photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treas@@ ured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
Predicted (-59.070160): so , I &apos;m not a big fan of my own , because I &apos;m a little bit of my camera , and I &apos;m sure that I &apos;ve been able to do this with the first time .
Ground Truth: there were no art directors , no sty@@ lists , no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots , not even any regard for lighting .
Predicted (-30.288761): there was no idea of making a difference , no one could not have any extra time .
Ground Truth: in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
Predicted (-33.743793): and as soon as the result of being able to be a little bit of the most famous .
Ground Truth: my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7th and 5@@ th .
Predicted (-73.867180): and I was a video that I was going to show my son , and my friend , who was in the middle of the morning , and I was in the middle of my head , and I was just a little bit of his name .
Ground Truth: we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Predicted (-40.971222): and so , in the &apos; 80s , we just kept thinking about this , and we would just be able to make a little bit more .
Ground Truth: well you can see where this is going .
Predicted (-6.516011): well , you can see that .
Ground Truth: approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a father @-@ daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
Predicted (-67.799789): and the next woman told me , &quot; When my daughter , my daughter , I &apos;m going to be a member of the New York Times , and she &apos;s not going to be a woman who &apos;s going to be able to take a school . &quot;
Src: damals fingen wir an , vorbei@@ laufende Touristen zu bitten , ein Bild von uns zu machen .
Ground Truth: this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
Predicted (-35.621830): so we started to look at the end of the film , and we would just be able to look at them .
Ground Truth: you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total stranger .
Predicted (-39.638706): you know , it &apos;s a very subtle thing that you &apos;re doing is that you &apos;re not just a little bit of a human being .
Ground Truth: no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Predicted (-31.897816): nobody &apos;s ever told you that the guy is not going to be a little bit of a mustache .
Ground Truth: back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
Predicted (-11.406831): and we didn &apos;t know how much this was happening in our life .
Src: diese Reise ist uns sehr heilig geworden .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
Predicted (-5.853215): this is a great journey .
Ground Truth: this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five @-@ year @-@ old could understand .
Predicted (-41.341053): and this was going to be on the back of the day , and I had to say , &quot; I &apos;ve got a seven @-@ year @-@ old idea .
Src: diese Bilder sind viel mehr als nur ein fest@@ ge@@ halten@@ er Moment , oder eine bestimmte Reise .
Ground Truth: so these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
Predicted (-24.092562): and this is a lot of time , and it &apos;s a little bit more difficult than ever .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Predicted (-56.123035): we are in a way that we &apos;re going to spend a few years of time and not just being able to do it , and we &apos;re going to be able to change our lives .
Ground Truth: because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mile@@ stones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
Predicted (-65.050446): because the same way that we see it is that when you look at the world , it &apos;s a very different way of changing your life , and you can see how they &apos;re going to start with the time .
Ground Truth: this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticipate the entire year .
Predicted (-38.962311): and this is a very small amount of time that we &apos;re going to get it , and we &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit more .
Ground Truth: recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
Predicted (-76.436180): and in the end , we &apos;ve been able to see a lot of time , and we &apos;ve got a little bit of a b@@ unk , and it &apos;s a little bit of a family that was coming up in the street .
Ground Truth: and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
Predicted (-27.043678): and she told me that she had the same age of the two years of being as a result .
Src: sie sagte , dass sie sich daran erinnert wie ihr das Herz aus der Brust sprang , als sie vor neun Jahren den Laden zum ersten Mal sah .
Ground Truth: she said she remembers her heart bur@@ sting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
Predicted (-28.239611): she said that she felt like the father of the first time she was born with her baby .
Ground Truth: and now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
Predicted (-29.217857): so , in New York , they &apos;re going to be in New York , because they &apos;re really a little bit of interest .
Src: und mir wurde schlag@@ artig klar : das Wichtigste , was wir alle erschaffen , sind Erinnerungen .
Ground Truth: and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
Predicted (-30.029049): and it &apos;s the most important thing that we &apos;ve been doing is , &quot; Oh , all of the things we &apos;ve done . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
Predicted (-25.620499): and I want to share with you a little bit of the idea of the self @-@ interest in the future .
Ground Truth: I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
Predicted (-33.088219): I don &apos;t know how much it &apos;s , but I &apos;m not sure that you &apos;re seeing a little bit of a video from the United States ./root/anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/_reduction.py:46: UserWarning: size_average and reduce args will be deprecated, please use reduction='sum' instead.

Src: ich bin immer der , der das Bild macht .
Ground Truth: I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
Predicted (-8.752782): I &apos;m the only person in the book .
Ground Truth: so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hes@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Predicted (-49.713257): I &apos;m going to talk to you about this , and I &apos;m going to ask you to have a little bit of a little bit of a doctor , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; What would you do ? &quot;
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.548745): thank you .
