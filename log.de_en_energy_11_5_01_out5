Ground Truth: that &apos;s why I co@@ founded Sol@@ a , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
Predicted (-73.457565): I started to do this for a young girl , and it &apos;s not only a good job for the first time to do it in the country , and to do it , to be a girl in the United States .
Ground Truth: the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
Predicted (-59.014473): it &apos;s like this , and I can see that the school is in a great school where they are all all in their own terms .

Ground Truth: &quot; kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
Predicted (-68.286140): and he says , &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that it &apos;s going to be a girl , but I &apos;m going to do it , and I will tell you that it &apos;s going to be a game .
Src: was Afghanistan angeht , so habe ich etwas erkannt , das im Westen oftmals ab@@ getan wird : hinter den meisten von uns , die Erfolg haben , steht ein Vater , der den Wert seiner Tochter erkennt und dem bewusst ist , dass ihr Erfolg auch sein Erfolg ist .
Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-152.593842): so I &apos;ve been told that in a war , which is a very good part of the conversation that is what we do is that they are in the war , and they &apos;re going to be a very proud @-@ to @-@ tell @-@ the @-@ to @-@ end @-@ the @-@ end @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ end @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ of @-@ day .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-23.890369): that means that our leader can &apos;t be a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-111.557678): they &apos;re now in the case of a very popular conversation , and they &apos;re not in the case of the fact that the women are in a way to be a successful @-@ and @-@ in @-@ the @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old , and that &apos;s why they are in the community .
Ground Truth: under the Taliban , girls who went to school num@@ bered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .

Ground Truth: I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; with@@ dra@@ wal .
Predicted (-44.913132): I think that the difference is that the driver &apos;s problems of the crime is going to be taken out of the road .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-79.586510): because I &apos;m in school school , when I &apos;m in the community , and I can take care of them , and then I can help help help them go to the school , and then they &apos;re in the middle of the future .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-59.795288): Afghanistan is a peace of a community , and I have to take the rest of the world and the day , and they have no hope to take the place .
Ground Truth: like me , they are dreaming big .

Predicted (-80.527786): so , in the way , I &apos;m not talking about it -- but I &apos;m here in the South Africa , and it &apos;s a little bit of the work of the U.N. -- it &apos;s not about the U.N. &apos;s work .
Ground Truth: I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .

Predicted (-67.778999): we were in a special place in the South Bronx , and this is a con@@ gre@@ gation of the National Cancer Foundation , and this is what we found in the South Bronx .
Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Ground Truth: but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
Predicted (-34.757515): but instead of trying to make sure that they were crazy , so we &apos;re all going to say , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re mad .

Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .

Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .

Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-58.661987): this is a little bit of a switch that &apos;s not just about the time is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more and more sensitive to the extent .

Predicted (-149.090088): and they decided to give it a message that was not not only in the United States , but it &apos;s not going to be used to be a pre@@ occupied basis for the American and the American media that they were allowed to do it , and that they were able to do it in the world , and that it &apos;s not not what they &apos;ve been able to do .
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.385823): you can do some of the interesting things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-68.666985): and the first thing I do -- I can actually do it -- and I &apos;m not going to be able to do it , but I have to do the first thing that is to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-31.068104): now , President Obama has a lawyer , and he &apos;s going to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-34.340740): if you can find a good thing , you can do that , then you &apos;ll have a new one .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-63.739098): and the third thing is that the most important thing is , in the world , is that it &apos;s not the first time , or the president of the United States , it &apos;s like &quot; The Ten Commandments . &quot;
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-50.648766): this is what I &apos;ve got to do with a couple of years ago , and this is the largest micro@@ credit card and the most exciting thing is .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-15.422482): and the story has been called the digital .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-7.227524): so this is the winner .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-17.406429): you have a great @-@ worth of .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-26.499758): and the other side of the planet is a kind of thing that &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.641197): now , you know , like a African party ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-2.716209): AB : seven .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-43.368832): it &apos;s like all of you , and this is a guy who &apos;s going to be on the front of the fire@@ flies .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-70.419876): so the third one has been done to be a p@@ iss , and that &apos;s not because you &apos;re going to be a man who will have lost the rest of the world .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-8.024398): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-55.310036): the ideas are to try to change the reality , and to do the reality of the words , and the reality is not only to change the same .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.145219): thank you very much .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .

Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .

Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-165.317688): now , there &apos;s a great career in this world , and I can tell you that there &apos;s no real real @-@ time @-@ to @-@ making @-@ art , and it &apos;s a kind of a kind of thing that I can do to do with these beautiful things that we can do to do it , and that it &apos;s not to be a little bit more about the way to do that we can do it to go to go to do that .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-296.139832): I have a day to be a man in a global global fight , and I have a de@@ de@@ de@@ <blank> ous mon@@ ous mon@@ a@@ um of the religious , and the reason it &apos;s going to be a legal and a legal @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ to @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ there @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ there @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ there @-@ to @-@ &quot; @-@ there @-@ go @-@ &quot; @-@ there @-@ &quot; @-@ &quot; @-@ the @-@ there @-@ &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-43.378246): now , the better one of the foreign aid is doing this , and I can do a campaign to do that .

Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-45.781509): and this is to try to do this , to try to do this , to make the bur@@ ners @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ year @-@ old girl .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-149.016342): I &apos;m going to go to the U.S. and try to give a job of a law@@ suit , and they &apos;re going to be able to do this in the streets of the police , and they &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit of the police in the U.S. , and they &apos;re going to give a little bit more money to go to the police and take the money .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-22.170689): I think that I would like to go to the conflict of Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-185.562881): the one of the things that you have to do is to create a kind of a re@@ fer@@ tile , and then you can do it in the world , and then you can use a long @-@ term , and then you can do it with a long @-@ term , and it &apos;s a kind of a re@@ re@@ designed tool that you can take a permanent permanent tool to the pro@@ pen@@ ding of the gar@@ ment of the living .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-268.337891): I can see this kind of a little bit of a new kind of like &quot; The Inter@@ state of the National Cancer Foundation is going to be able to take a look at the fact of the world , and that &apos;s a little bit of a pro@@ ver@@ sa@@ tional @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ to @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ to @-@ to @-@ the @-@ there @-@ there @-@ see @-@ to @-@ go @-@ go @-@ go @-@ go @-@ see @-@ there @-@ there @-@ to @-@ to @-@ there @-@ there @-@ to @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ write piece piece piece piece piece piece piece piece of @-@ the @-@ go @-@
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .

Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-12.330004): but I do it because it &apos;s the way to do it .

Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-6.100883): so , 10 years ago .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-49.522327): I mean , this is a whole kind of a break in the room , because I have a little bit of a hand@@ made .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-10.306176): I have a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-37.943672): this is the first time you get to get a TED Talk , and I think you &apos;re going to get to get a happy person .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-32.354496): now , I have a lot of people , and I &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re going to do that .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-37.639511): I &apos;m actually in a very difficult position , because I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit more difficult than I can tell you about that .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-9.959276): and this is not the one .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-31.260262): they &apos;re very good at this , because I &apos;m not sure they &apos;re all supposed to be .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-42.270634): the key is to make a little bit of my mind , because I &apos;m going to tell you that they &apos;re going to do something like that .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.772575): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.990480): now , why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-3.400597): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-11.399669): now , it was not so inspiring .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-13.806978): so , a symbol is a remarkable thing .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-25.628246): I have to be in my mind , and it &apos;s been about 30 seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-18.180199): and this is a moment -- I had a real audience .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-48.954803): I was very proud of my dad and he was looking at me and I was trying to put a little bit of the power of my wife .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-135.564117): and the one of these days , when I was in the back of the time , it &apos;s not just a little bit of time , and it &apos;s a little bit of the time that we have to do it , and it &apos;s a little bit of the power of the power that we have to do it , and it &apos;s a little bit like that .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-14.143504): it &apos;s a bit easier to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-5.958405): I &apos;m sitting on this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-33.260391): I &apos;m on this side of a nice , because I &apos;m a girl , and I &apos;m a young man .

Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-24.151974): I &apos;m going to ask the question of questions , but I &apos;m going to ask people to do that .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-6.114652): the first question is : how do you do ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-20.329845): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve got to say that , but it &apos;s all .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-43.865070): the reason I think this is a green @-@ up version of a brand , and that &apos;s a great honor of a charity .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-121.595383): now , in some of us , we have a very good part of the beauty of the world , and it &apos;s a very good @-@ known , but it &apos;s a very difficult @-@ to @-@ to @-@ end @-@ up @-@ to @-@ point point point , and we &apos;re also being able to be able to do something like a little bit more .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-18.355865): this is a legacy for me , and it &apos;s a legacy for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-64.101425): there &apos;s a great audience . there are people who are like to be a good one . I think , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be a bit of a guy .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-16.261215): and then I &apos;m going to show you a very impressive .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-136.936478): now , I &apos;ve shown you that in the last four years , and it &apos;s a student that I could have been doing a little bit of the original , but the only one of the four @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old @-@ class , and the @-@ class , the @-@ no @-@ brain@@ er , but it &apos;s a way to do that .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-17.543571): the next question is , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; What is it ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.319695): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really know what to do .
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-13.633705): but the second one I want to ask is this little girl .
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.633733): you know what you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;

Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-57.749233): so , when you &apos;re talking about this , it &apos;s a big big mis@@ says , &quot; I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s a theoretical theoretical . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-64.136307): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , and it &apos;s not a good @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ for @-@ the @-@ time @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ one @-@ third @-@ American @-@ American @-@ art .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-41.691402): so , you &apos;ll say , &quot; You know , you &apos;ll have a game that &apos;s going to be a bit more like that .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-17.708820): it &apos;s not going to be true and it &apos;s not going to be awesome .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-37.440937): now I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s possible to do that in a single @-@ dimensional relationship .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-302.390930): there &apos;s a lady who &apos;s going to be a little bit like this , and then you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a man that &apos;s going to be here , and then you &apos;re going to be able to see the old , and then you &apos;re going to see that the next one is a piece of the first time , and then you &apos;re going to go to the camera , and then you have to get the touch it &apos;s a little bit like that there there , and then you get to get to get to get out of the camera , and that &apos;s a little bit like that &apos;s where we have to get out of the baby , and we have to get there there there there there there there there &apos;s the camera that the bin@@
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .

Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-12.557131): I think that &apos;s a little bit more than that .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-8.668589): I was like , OK .
Predicted (-109.094566): so , a school has a little bit of a school , and it &apos;s not going to be a little bit more , but it &apos;s going to be a school where you can say , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re going to go to the bank , and you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the city .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-14.097442): so the next question is , &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .

Ground Truth: but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
Predicted (-285.768036): I &apos;m so happy to be able to do this , and I &apos;m going to be happy , but I &apos;m going to be able to do this , and I think that it &apos;s not going to be able to do it , because I have to be able to do that , and I think it &apos;s a little bit like that , and I &apos;ve been able to do it , and I have to do it to be able to be able to do it to be so long enough to be fun to do that , and I have to be able to do it to get to get out of that because I I have to get out of the last time to get to get out of the last time to be fun to have to be there there to be fun

Ground Truth: aware of the devast@@ ation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Liby@@ an civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .

Predicted (-67.952873): now , I can show you a new video of the technology that &apos;s been used to be a kind of time @-@ lapse photography , which is a massive wave of the silk .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-70.176086): so we can take the camera to see these images of our eyes and go to the center of the space , and we can see a little bit of the robot to go to the outside of the box .

Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-121.458755): so , it &apos;s a moment of time , because it &apos;s a little bit like this , and it &apos;s a bit of time , but it &apos;s a little bit like this , you can see the speed of the screen , and then you can see the speed of the human record , and that &apos;s the key thing that you have to do .

Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-29.555025): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that &apos;s going to be filled with a little bit of the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-49.043449): the walls are coming in the area , and the point is that the sound of the walls are coming out of the line .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-90.811722): now , if you have a video of the average , and you have a little bit of the time that you &apos;re going to go to the next 10 minutes , and you can see the ball of the robot , and then you have to see what we &apos;re going to do .

Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-10.970687): it &apos;s like a rock in a balloon .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-64.819603): and so it was like this , because it &apos;s a picture of a human being , and it &apos;s actually actually a picture of the sound that we &apos;re looking at .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-69.545029): now if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit more , and if you have to be able to see that the dark side is going to be able to keep the rest of your life .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-53.837498): this is why the light is that it &apos;s a little bit of a turn and it &apos;s going to take a bottle of the pollen .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-92.970421): so in this case , if you can take a camera in the lab , you can see it in a place where it &apos;s possible to be a li@@ der , and you can actually actually put it in your pocket , and you can actually get to the point of the person .

Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-97.784157): now , you know , if you have a video , you can see a little bit of a time , and you have a little bit of a time that you can do it , and you have a little bit more than a time that you can do it in the sky .

Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-7.242921): this is a idea of light .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-63.607937): it &apos;s going to be a hole in the center of the door , and then you can see that it &apos;s going to be taken off the door , and we &apos;re going to be able to go back to the door .

Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-51.746387): the idea of being being published in a paper that was made in the &apos; 30s , and it &apos;s made of a collaborative collaborative consumption .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-300.360626): they &apos;re going to be able to make these blue dots , and then we &apos;re going to be able to make a light @-@ up , and then you &apos;re going to see the light of these little dots , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get a signal , and that &apos;s the most part of the light that &apos;s going to be taken to the most of the rest of our ears and the time , and then they will have a lot of our bodies , and then they have to be taken through the light , and then you get the rest of these these these these little hits the light , and then you will have a little little hits the amount of these these are coming up up up up up and they have to get the amount of the
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-25.589197): and so we have a camera that &apos;s actually a camera -- it &apos;s just like a camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-16.066013): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s a real time .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-51.495514): so , we know that the time is not to be the connection of the road , but it &apos;s not what we know to do .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-281.635864): if we &apos;re going to make a film , we can see a little bit of a little bit of a box , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and if you can see this , it &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we can see that the camera , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more , and that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sound that &apos;s going to be made of a little bit of a little bit of a piece of the sound that &apos;s going to be made of the camera that &apos;s going to be called that we have to be made of the camera that we &apos;re going to be able to be going to be able to do that we have

Predicted (-50.530525): it &apos;s actually going to be made up of a massive amount of light , and we would see that this is going to be a very famous movie .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-68.102615): in the past , in the context of the moment , it &apos;s been shown in the space , and it &apos;s a matter of time in the digital sphere that &apos;s going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .

Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-60.221855): so I &apos;m a very good deal with a general general problem with me , and it &apos;s a very good deal with the fact that I &apos;m a professional @-@ based business .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-3.312358): nobody knows what we do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-12.033446): now I &apos;m going to try to do what I do .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-10.599445): food is a major in action .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-77.485641): we &apos;re doing this with the full @-@ time @-@ like @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ there @-@ to @-@ the @-@ art @-@ like @-@ there @-@ the @-@ day @-@ old .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-57.171074): so , in a form of a large , and it &apos;s a unique component of the material that you can have a special relationship to the extent .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-59.931568): now , the mis@@ sil@@ ks of this , and it &apos;s a very good way to do this , and it &apos;s a very good way to do that .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-17.298973): and so , in many years , you have a lot of work .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-197.203674): there are still two women who are living in the world , and they have to do with the long @-@ term , and we have to do that to have the disease of the disease that we have to do that , and the more time to do that , to be more to be able to do that , and to do that , to do that , to be more , to be more to be more to the long @-@ to the long , to the disease .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-84.633049): we can do that , and we can do it in the first time , and we can actually have to do that , and we can do it , but it &apos;s a sense of the only thing that we can do to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-104.139580): so , it &apos;s also a good thing for the di@@ etary activity , and it &apos;s a good thing for the time , and it &apos;s not a good thing to do . so you can see that there &apos;s a lot of these two @-@ dimensional sensors that you can see .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-38.374920): it &apos;s done to be a hospital in the hospital , and it &apos;s a little bit more expensive . it &apos;s not going to be done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-16.497866): so what if patients were going to take a test ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-30.810947): this is a hospital that could go to the clinic , and then they would do that .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-12.342019): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-15.925665): it &apos;s about 300 dollars to make a drug .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-43.981255): so I want to do a very special moment , because we do do do something that &apos;s in the present way .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-16.073040): here &apos;s a video video that you see a rubber band .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-113.051712): so , in a sense of being a human being , because we &apos;re going to have a sense of what we do is we &apos;re going to do , and we can do that , because we have a lot of these neurons that we have to do , and we can see that we &apos;re going to do it .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-13.372774): and so we have a lot of practice .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-16.742971): so you know , for a long time , it &apos;s like a kid .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-47.280540): so you can move the position of the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> ly , and so on on the right .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-31.830494): so on the left , you can see a little bit of the par@@ ab@@ e@@ able .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.465489): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-30.184456): so , your moral , you have a di@@ li@@ ble .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-27.546764): and the person is actually going to be a more and more of the speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-142.978821): so this is a positive @-@ controlled ability to be able to do with the attention of the video , and it &apos;s a lot of attention to the digital , and it &apos;s actually a multi @-@ cell@@ er , and it &apos;s a multi @-@ @-@ @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s now now that it &apos;s going to be able to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-40.728428): so these are the clinical trials , if you can do it , you can see , you know , they &apos;re not in clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-10.672935): so , there &apos;s no way .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-7.391666): you have to build a new factory .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-6.513861): and they &apos;re both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-12.712406): so you can go into a camp .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-8.495232): they &apos;re very , very fast .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-9.998668): they &apos;re very cheap . and we know what this is .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-23.228386): so , it &apos;s a very cheap thing , and it &apos;s actually a lot of things .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-10.963776): so this is the ability to do this .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-10.835802): we can help the health care .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-21.126446): you have no patients to have a di@@ etary target .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-16.595572): we can use the data of a new frontier .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-66.752434): we can do that for a clinical clinical trial , and we can use the number of these kinds of studies to be used to be a global @-@ effective @-@ effective .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-25.995895): now we have the first time to find the microbial community to do something for the disease .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-22.685919): now we &apos;re going to do this now , and we &apos;re going to start to do this .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-62.904579): I have a co@@ ward of a day , and we have a number of people to put on the table , and we can have access to the digital value of this .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-38.951302): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and you have a half of the planet that &apos;s available to one of those .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-66.425232): so , if you can do a video , you can have a three @-@ month @-@ to @-@ a @-@ day day , and we have to do that with a lot of these things that we can do .

Ground Truth: thank you .

Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?

Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-6.574302): what are you going to do ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-45.180073): so what happens is that the person &apos;s been to get a patient &apos;s attention to the point where it &apos;s not going to be .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-12.259562): maybe you can &apos;t get to the end .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-54.495766): there &apos;s a variety of different sources of information , because it &apos;s important to be in our studies , because there are these kinds of things that are available to be a specific place .

Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-33.917847): and this is the father of the mine and the mine is on the left of the shoe .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-36.869324): in the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very protected area .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-20.673069): the queen , they are going to do the ones .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-8.227038): they &apos;re called our kill .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .

Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-52.874989): the one of the creatures that I &apos;ve been born in the forest , and that is the wild of the earth , and we have to do that .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-11.415242): I was a kid to learn .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-25.134167): our soldiers are called the O@@ il and our enemies .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .

Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-23.263096): here &apos;s a woman who was in a seven @-@ up fishing .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-49.168957): and I think there &apos;s a big threat in the world -- it &apos;s not a co@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ as .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-44.307323): this is a woman in the middle of the forest , and he was so much like my brother , and he was in the morning .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.710714): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.922802): the first idea was a fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-29.532364): and then it was clear that it &apos;s not possible to help help us understand what the heck might be .

Predicted (-25.249279): I wanted to be the first person I was wearing a cheese sandwich .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
