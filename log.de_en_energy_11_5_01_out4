Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-23.050297): that means that our leader can &apos;t be paid in a good way .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-79.917641): they &apos;re often asked to be in the case of the most successful , and in fact , in a way , it &apos;s a good part of the fact that the women are in their homes are in the future .

Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-23.295101): we have a fantastic passion to help the technology and the government of the world .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-82.499840): our social scientists are in our business , and we &apos;re looking at the fact that there &apos;s no problem in our health and health , and it &apos;s a lot of people who are in our field , and I think we &apos;re going to talk about what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-36.491600): but the amazing thing is that our colleagues are not going to be there , because we &apos;re going to be a lot of experts .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-16.313396): so scientists , engineers , and I &apos;m going to do it .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-26.422939): I &apos;ll show you a couple of examples , and I can tell you that this is what we can do .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-19.894012): the first question that you have to do is , and they &apos;re like , right ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-17.772942): now , you know , this is a global basis for what &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-106.874985): they &apos;re not saying that they &apos;re going to be a bit more interested in the code , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re going to be able to do these kinds of mis@@ mis@@ es , and then they &apos;re going to be able to see that they &apos;re going to be a little bit more .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-20.671967): and what you do is that you make it a bit more .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-12.756308): there &apos;s a key to understanding .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-59.851646): now , &quot; You know , &quot; I &apos;m not going to ask him , but it &apos;s a time for a moment and it &apos;s not going to be in the &apos; 60s . &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-27.095650): you have to understand the idea of what it is not going to be done .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-21.475380): now , Einstein has done this , and it &apos;s not like anything .
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-28.773554): you can tell me a lot of this is a secret to the democratic system .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-34.648422): there &apos;s a couple of things that are going to be here to be a few things about these things .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-20.667507): and if you have your work , you can get the credit .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-14.445311): now , you have to ask yourself what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-32.941105): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to get a conversation , and then you get a little bit of it .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-45.889271): so this is a little bit of a mis@@ conception of being turned out to be less and less than the first time .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-70.616562): so this is a common common component of the cultural detail that it &apos;s so much more important than the original idea of the National Academy is that it &apos;s a very special place .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-111.358192): one is the only one that &apos;s a little bit more than the use of the computer , and it &apos;s a little bit more than the use of the magic that you can do , and it &apos;s the only way that it &apos;s going to be able to do that , and I can show you a little bit more .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-35.335361): so there &apos;s some of these guys who are trying to go to the open @-@ up and go to the art and try to see that .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .

Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-24.784090): and the other side of the planet is a kind of thing that has been done .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.460330): now , you know , like a African party ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-2.099333): AB : seven .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-40.753956): you know , it &apos;s all like the guy who &apos;s going to be on the front of these giant chicken .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-61.550499): so the third one has been lost , and the rest of the country is not so much , because you have to say that the president is in the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-7.237087): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-54.826080): the ideas are to try to change the reality , and to do the reality of the words , and the reality is not only to change the same .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.112605): thank you very much .

Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .

Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-3.179266): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-172.704880): and I was at the time of a long time , with a big girl who was sitting in the last five years of the day , and I was talking about the old @-@ fashioned , and they were able to take a ma@@ c@@ ad@@ se@@ min@@ er to the American and to go to the local , and we have a good deal with the world of the food and the world .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .

Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-93.648293): so here I &apos;m a Muslim @-@ lived , and the West of the world , with a kind of a Jewish Jewish , and a half @-@ year @-@ old artist , and the war of the world .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-133.862518): now , there &apos;s a great thing to do with these beautiful things , and I can tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it , and that &apos;s what we can do to do with the art of the world , and I think that it &apos;s a kind of a non @-@ verbal , and it &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a few more difficult thing to do .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-138.777924): I have a day to live in a new country , a young man , a secret agent of violence and religion , and they are going to be a mis@@ mis@@ mis@@ use of the oil @-@ based , and they &apos;re going to be able to do a lot of the mis@@ use of the &quot; sex@@ ist . &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-44.156765): now , the better one of the foreign aid is doing this , and I can do a campaign to do that . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-46.667934): and this is to try to use this to do the research @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ day @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ way way way .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-149.701233): I &apos;m going to talk about a car in the world where the police are going to be a little bit more about the road , and they &apos;re going to be able to take a box of the police and the police department , and they &apos;re going to give them a little bit of the money to do it , and they &apos;re going to go to the streets of the U.S. .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-30.150497): I think that in my opinion , the conflict of Afghanistan is going to be in the &apos; 80s .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-257.151276): the other thing is that the Al@@ ig@@ ig@@ ig@@ ni@@ te is that you can have a kind of a long @-@ term , and then you can put it in a way to do it in the world , and then you can use a long @-@ term , and you can take a tool to do it in a traditional fashion , and then you can take a few of the bur@@ gers to the bur@@ gers to the gar@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ p@@ a long @-@ to the gar@@ ment of the bot@@ s to the bot@@ s to the gar@@ ts and have to the gar@@ ment .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-260.899109): I can see this as a little bit of a &quot; The New Yorker &quot; is going to take a look at the kind of de@@ code of the world , and that &apos;s a great example of the fact that there &apos;s a little bit of the time of the war of the O@@ .C. to go to the National Security Council , and to try to take out out of the pro@@ ver@@ t @-@ to the pro@@ se@@ cu@@ per@@ per@@ per@@ se@@ cu@@ es of the de@@ per@@ per@@ per@@ per@@ per@@ se@@ cu@@ ous materials to see that there there , and to see that there of the site .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-14.424247): but in all these things , you can do it .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-12.133308): but I do it because it &apos;s the way we do it .

Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-5.119244): 10 years ago ,
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-59.112091): I mean , this is a sense of being in a room that I &apos;ve been able to do this in a box that I &apos;ve made a little bit of a secret .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-10.496211): I have a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-37.620987): this is the first time you get to the TED Talk , and you can see that you &apos;re going to get a happy person .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-33.827370): now , I have a lot of people , because I &apos;m not really sure that they &apos;re going to do it .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-36.423176): I &apos;m actually in a very difficult position , because I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit more difficult than I can tell you about that .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-11.128732): and this is not the only one .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-28.378513): they &apos;re very silly , because I &apos;m not sure they &apos;re all supposed to be good .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-41.381020): the key is to make a little bit of my mind , because I &apos;m going to tell you that they &apos;re going to do something like this .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.609100): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.569882): now , why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-3.176845): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-11.098147): now , it was not so inspiring .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-13.480805): so , a symbol is a remarkable thing .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.653814): I &apos;ve been able to do this in every five seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-15.502436): and this is a moment -- I had no idea .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-47.639866): I was very proud of my dad , and he was looking at me and I was trying to put a little bit of the power of my wife .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-136.028976): and at the time , the A@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ o , I think that there &apos;s no time to do it , and it &apos;s a little bit of time to be able to do it , and that it &apos;s a little bit of time to be a little bit of the power of the power of our relationship .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-10.374844): it &apos;s too difficult to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-5.947761): I &apos;m sitting on this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-32.485184): I &apos;m on this side of a nice , because I &apos;m a girl , and I &apos;m a young man .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-24.492243): I &apos;m going to ask the question that I &apos;m going to ask you to ask the question of people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-11.882132): the first question is , &quot; How is it going to be a model ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-13.617209): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been saying that .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-43.628029): the reason I think this is a green model of a charity , and that &apos;s a very important example of what they &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-121.129883): now , in some of us , we have a very good part of the beauty of the world , and it &apos;s a very good , but it &apos;s a very , very difficult @-@ to @-@ end @-@ up @-@ to @-@ point point point @-@ old , and they &apos;re also known to be a little bit more like a living .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-17.767681): this is a legacy for me , and it &apos;s a legacy for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-65.195427): there &apos;s a very good audience . I think that there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to be on the right , and it &apos;s like a call of &quot; R@@ R@@ ace . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-16.239571): and then I &apos;m going to show you a very impressive operation .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-128.933395): but I &apos;ve shown you that in the last four years , in the case of the student , the first one of the four @-@ year @-@ old , and the only one that &apos;s the most significant use of the English @-@ based version of the screen is not going to be able to get a little bit of the time .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-16.378017): the next question is , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; What is it ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.709524): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really know what to do .
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-16.205116): but the second one I want to ask is , &quot; Why is there a little girl ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.500955): you know what you &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-104.248322): you can have the U.S. or the American person in the world , and you have a call of the &quot; the most @-@ time @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ heart @-@ the @-@ day @-@ old @-@ old @-@ old @-@ fashioned , because it &apos;s what you do .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-51.969574): so , when you &apos;re talking about this , it &apos;s not going to be a big fan , I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not going to be a business . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-106.473503): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , and it &apos;s not a good @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ end @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ American @-@ American @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ the @-@ art @-@ the @-@ art @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ the @-@ hand .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-40.574474): so , you &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , you &apos;ll have to do that , you know , you &apos;ll have to do that .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-17.075394): it can &apos;t be solved , and it &apos;s not going to be awesome .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-33.544834): now I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s possible to do a single @-@ dimensional problem .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-292.393280): there &apos;s a little man who &apos;s sitting there , and then you can see that there &apos;s a little bit like this , and then you &apos;re going to be able to see the first one , and then you can see that the camera is going to go back to the front of the foot , and then you &apos;re going to go to the end of the day , and then you have a little bit of the old , and then you have a little bit like that &apos;s there , and then you have to get to get to get to get out of the old , and there &apos;s a little bit of the old , and we have to get out of the baby , and we have to get there there there &apos;s a little bit like that the bin@@ go to
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-6.164701): it &apos;s about that .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-9.613980): sometimes this is a little bit more than that .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-8.047421): I was like , OK .
Predicted (-106.270393): so , a school has a little bit of a school , and it &apos;s not going to be a little bit more , but it &apos;s going to be a school where you can say , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the city , and you can get a lot of money .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-14.966545): so the question is , &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .

Predicted (-62.237835): there are groups of artists and artists and artists , and they are all the kind of open @-@ source of the web and the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> ers .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-19.085423): now , the next thing is , you ask yourself , &quot; What are you doing ?
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-74.156662): I have a number of guys who are in a few days , I &apos;m not going to be able to do the most high @-@ quality of the day , but I have to do things that are going to be more fun .

Predicted (-68.709541): so I can show you a new video of the technology that &apos;s been used to be a kind of time that I can show you a massive @-@ scale video of the process .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-77.163872): so we can take the camera to see these images of our eyes and go to the center of the space , and we can see a little bit of the robot , and we can actually go to the outside of the box .
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-153.307877): now , I &apos;ll give you a brief signal , and that &apos;s a little bit more than a thousand @-@ hour flight -- and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be able to do this -- and that &apos;s a little bit more than a single @-@ dimensional , and the next one of the four @-@ dimensional dimensions , and that &apos;s a little bit like this is a little bit of the speed of the Earth .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-56.823795): so , if you take this piece of a magnetic field , you can take the balls into the ice , and then you get into the bottle of the bottle .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-9.257317): so , what &apos;s going on ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-5.343569): so this is a whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-96.319641): so , of course , this is a moment of time , because it &apos;s a little bit like this , and it &apos;s a bit more than the speed of the light that you can do , and you can see the speed of the screen , but it &apos;s going to be able to do this .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-17.185719): no , Coca @-@ Cola is not going to have this research .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-18.298290): so this is a big movie that I &apos;ll show you what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-45.897724): so , the next piece of a magnetic field , which is called a magnetic field that &apos;s going to turn into the box .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-24.792240): and it &apos;s a little bit of the water coming out of the table .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-40.178844): the most surprising one is that the whole neuron has come up with a lot of the extra .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-28.906921): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that &apos;s going to be filled with a little bit of the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-81.887115): the walls are coming up in the area , and the amount of the sound that you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the walls , and they &apos;re going to be used to be a little bit of the number of images .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-90.652115): so if you have a video of the last time , and you have a little bit of the X @-@ ray , and you can see the next time , and you have to see the ball of the screen , and we &apos;re going to go to the next 10 years .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-7.298221): a week , a third one .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-26.382906): this is a very interesting -- a little bit of a slow , a little bit of time .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-16.377470): and what does it live in a little bit of time ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-32.384338): you can see the same thing , and the rivers come up with the walls and the bottom .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-10.749274): it &apos;s like a rock in a balloon .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-50.502720): and it was so that I would like to see a picture of a human being , but it &apos;s actually a very beautiful image .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-56.818672): now if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit more , and if you have to be able to see that the dark light is going to be left .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-64.305107): this is why the light is that it &apos;s a little bit of a stick and it &apos;s going to take the nectar and then you get it into a little bit .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-77.321877): so , in this case , if you can take a camera in the lab , you can see that it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to be in a box , and it &apos;s a place where you can actually get away from the air .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-11.867909): so , my team at MIT has built ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-90.994926): now , if you have a video of a time , you can see that you have a little bit more than a few minutes , and you can see that the ball is a real time , because you have a little bit more difficult to do this .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-123.154709): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to take this video , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the data that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we &apos;re going to do this , and we &apos;re going to make a multi @-@ touch @-@ dimensional , and then we can see this kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-18.567440): and we can use all these data and start to get these things .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-11.188755): so , this is a fly .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-72.286697): so , these are beautiful creatures that can lead to a new world , and it can be like a permanent @-@ to @-@ make @-@ look for @-@ up @-@ like @-@ a @-@ star star .
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-6.767709): this is the idea of light .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-66.827881): it &apos;s going to be thrown out in the center of the door , and then you can see that the door is going to be in the middle of the day , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the camera .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-11.874130): this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve actually got it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.441295): and you see the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-28.066208): and the wall is behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to have a light on the door .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-59.044250): the idea of being made in the paper was made by a plastic , and it &apos;s been made of a collaborative visualization that &apos;s been published .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-299.140289): they &apos;re going to be able to make these blue dots , and then we &apos;re going to be able to see the light of the sound of these three @-@ dimensional , and then you can see that every single one of these lights are going to be a little bit of the sound , and then they &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of the light and then they &apos;re going to get to be taken off the inside the inside the blood and then they &apos;re going to be taken through the sound , and then they &apos;re going to be taken through the inside the signal that &apos;s going to get through the inside the air , and they &apos;re going to get a lot of the air , and we &apos;re going to get the signal , and they &apos;re going
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-25.037197): and so we have a camera that &apos;s actually a camera -- it &apos;s just like a camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.482090): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s a very good time in the world .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-47.304192): so , we know that the time is not to be the connection of the sun , but it &apos;s not what we know .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-274.475037): if we &apos;re going to show a film , we can see a little bit of a little bit of a box , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and if you can see this , it &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we can see that the camera , and then we &apos;re going to be able to do that , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be going to do with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the sound , and then , and that is to be able to be able to be called it , and we have to do that , and we have to do that is we &apos;re going to be going to be going to do that that &apos;s because
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-4.040861): can we do it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-9.908735): so here &apos;s our own operations .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-244.719666): we have to do this in a few years , and we can imagine that if we can go back to the lab , and we can see that we can take the right @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ one @-@ day @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ and @-@ to @-@ one @-@ the @-@ one @-@ the @-@ one @-@ dimensional thing that is @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ one @-@ time time understanding understanding of @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ one thing that is because because because we we we we we can do do do is @-@ to @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ step vision vision vision vision vision vision vision vision vision vision vision vision that we can
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-144.304367): and because of the de@@ code is so powerful , and it &apos;s a kind of a kind of de@@ de@@ de@@ de@@ fied tool that I can imagine that it &apos;s going to be a very difficult time to do this in the first time , and that &apos;s a rather than a human @-@ to @-@ a @-@ a @-@ to @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ story story .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-173.406921): so , in fact , as an artist , in the movie , is a great science fiction , and it &apos;s a great time that we can use this , and it &apos;s a fantastic example of the fact that we have been able to do this , and we can see that it &apos;s a four @-@ dimensional space , and it &apos;s not only only a time time time that &apos;s been recorded in the history of the history of the history of the history of the video .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-8.650826): but there &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-25.975529): if you look at this red line , you &apos;ll see the waves of the road .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-6.937536): the waves should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.877938): what &apos;s happening ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-48.592125): it &apos;s actually going to be made up of a massive amount of light , and we would see that this is going to be a very strange thing .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-66.331955): in the past , in the context of the moment , it &apos;s been shown in the center of the sphere , and it &apos;s not possible to be able to do that in the context of the words .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-340.321869): so instead of giving us a new tool of all the time , and it &apos;s going to be able to take the idea of the creation of our own , and we &apos;re going to take the tools of the world , and we &apos;re going to be able to take the source of the scientific and the most advanced and the knowledge of the world , and the use of the technology of the pro@@ per@@ per@@ il of the pro@@ pro@@ per@@ il of the knowledge of our knowledge of the time , and the information , to be available available available , and the information that is to go back to be available , and the technology that we can be available , and to be available , and to be available for the long @-@ based on the long @-@ based on the collection of

Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-8.678802): there are many ways of making our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-37.370522): you don &apos;t have a street in the world , because we don &apos;t know how to make the li@@ f@@ ings .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .

Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-27.242737): how can we take our imagination into the living and the building of the world ?
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-27.423252): so what can we do is we can create our own communities and our dreams .

Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-136.195007): I &apos;ve taken this whole bunch of people who have been taken to the foundation of their own community , and then they were able to do this , and then I started to go to the world , and then they have a great school where they were able to do this , and then they were able to do this , and then they have a whole bunch of people .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-55.329971): we have seen that our power is a way to make our public choices , and we can make a lot of people to be able to do the right .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-20.398159): one of the things that we have is the most important thing to do is to connect people .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-52.718624): there &apos;s a lot of time in the world that &apos;s more about the way to think about the truth of life and to do something that &apos;s more comfortable .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-73.280647): they &apos;re talking about death , and I think that it &apos;s not about what we do , and that &apos;s what I do to tell you about death , but it &apos;s a bit about the fact that we have to do that .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-9.756729): the idea of death is about this .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-71.290001): the most common sense of our community is about bringing up to the world , and it &apos;s important to help us to connect our lives and to help people , and that &apos;s what we can do .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.025323): thank you .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.025323): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-40.010616): so I &apos;m a very good deal with a general general problem , with a company that is very good for me .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-2.882036): nobody knows what we do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-18.633205): now I &apos;m going to try to do this , and I &apos;ll tell you what to do .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-7.505995): food is one of the most important activities .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-52.281113): we &apos;re doing this with the full @-@ time @-@ like @-@ old , and you can see the glasses of the st@@ ool .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-77.760376): so , in a form of a large , a broad component , and it &apos;s a unique component of the material that you can have to be a very well @-@ known and a technical component .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-60.785080): now , the mis@@ sil@@ ks of this , and it &apos;s a very good way to do this , and it &apos;s a very good way to do that .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-17.154999): and so , in many years , you have a lot of work .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-151.324738): there are still two women who are living in the world , and they have to do with the long @-@ term , and we have to do that , to have the disease of the disease that we have to do , and to do that , to try to save the long @-@ term , and to be more than five years , and to have no longer to be more vulnerable to the disease .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-69.878006): we can do the ability to do it , and we can only have to do it in the moment , and that &apos;s the only way we can find that there &apos;s a real time to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-56.802582): so , in fact , there &apos;s a lot of pain , and it &apos;s a good thing for the blind patients , and it &apos;s not a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-34.504345): it &apos;s done to be a hospital , and it &apos;s a very expensive thing . it &apos;s not going to be done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-15.487263): but what if patients were going to take a test ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-30.604916): this is a hospital that could go to the clinic , and then they would do that .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-12.014815): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-15.796242): it &apos;s about 250 dollars to make a drug .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-39.965984): so I want to do something that &apos;s a very special moment , because we can do this in the present way .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-11.417980): here &apos;s a video video that you see .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-115.440948): so , in a sense of being a human being , because we can do it , and we have a lot of mis@@ use , and we can do that , because we &apos;re going to have a message , and we have to do that , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the same thing .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-16.002127): and so we have a practice of doing it .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-22.653492): so imagine that you have a long time to think about how to do it .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-54.619980): so , you can move the li@@ li@@ li@@ li@@ ts from the skin , and so you can see the li@@ li@@ li@@ ars .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-31.294945): so on the left , you can see a little bit of the par@@ ab@@ e@@ able .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.178362): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-21.356728): voice , a moral , un@@ desirable .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-32.811996): the person is actually playing with a speech and it &apos;s actually a more fun of the speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-279.422577): so this ability to be able to be able to do a piece of video , and it &apos;s a lot of attention to the digital , but it &apos;s also a good @-@ time @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ end @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ of @-@ the @-@ to @-@ because @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ hand , and @-@ go @-@ go @-@ there @-@ go @-@ there @-@ there @-@ to @-@ there @-@ there @-@ to @-@ go @-@ go @-@ to @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ go @-@ the @-@ because @-@ there @-@ and @-@ the @-@ the @-@ and @-@
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-45.301609): so these are the clinical trials , if you can do it , you can &apos;t do it , but you can see that in the clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-11.307195): so , the infrastructure is very .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-9.218048): you have no need to build a new factory .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-5.899346): and they &apos;re both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.255277): so they can be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-7.358432): they &apos;re very , very fast .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-8.302671): they &apos;re very cheap , and we know what this is .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-23.471479): so , it &apos;s a very cheap thing , and it &apos;s actually a lot of things .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-11.039085): so this is the ability to do that .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-15.264122): we can help the health of those situations .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-20.425026): you can have a few patients to do the decision @-@ making .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-22.873470): we can use the data to be able to explore the planet .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.829624): we can use these large @-@ scale technologies to do a single @-@ year @-@ old , and we can actually do that .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-26.399286): now we have the first time to explore the microbial community , to find out the disease of the time .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-24.656420): now we &apos;re going to do this now , and we &apos;re going to start to get the key .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-65.880112): and I have a live @-@ up @-@ up @-@ to @-@ hand , and we have a number of people to have access to the Internet to the extent that we can do that .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-30.732697): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and the half of the planet is about 100 percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-93.000961): if you can do a video , you can have a three @-@ month @-@ to @-@ a @-@ day day , and we can do it with a four @-@ minute , because we have to do something that &apos;s been used to be able to do with a lot of the food .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.025323): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-22.070930): if we take a sample of thousands of people , you can tell them what they &apos;re going to be healthy .
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-5.811664): what are you going to do ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-25.572523): so what happens is that the person &apos;s attention is to get a patient .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-11.413827): maybe you can &apos;t get to the end .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-41.532608): there &apos;s a huge variety of different sources of information , because it &apos;s important to be in our studies , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-16.997242): now , the average of them is 0.@@ 5 percent .

Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-4.200963): it &apos;s a good thing .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-62.824821): my father &apos;s work , and I was able to show that it &apos;s a fantastic job , because it &apos;s so important for us to do this -- and it &apos;s a very exciting thing to do .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-4.711470): this is what I call .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-58.556396): this is the person who can show the phone , and then you can get the phone , and you can get the phone , and then you can get the person to get the attention .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-10.746042): I live here in the mountains of Nairobi .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-23.592222): and the fellow on the left of the river is my father .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-37.118244): in the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very protected area .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-17.522545): the queen , they are taking the names .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-2.665513): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-37.994431): this is one of my father , and I was in the morning , and it was dead . it was all over the morning .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-45.911953): the elephant that I call the Middle East , and the wild is that we have to be able to do the wild .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-8.398706): I had a child to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-27.495632): our soldiers are called the O@@ il and the O@@ il .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.223616): and kill lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-13.160166): here &apos;s a woman who was in Portugal .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-33.856430): and I think there &apos;s a big threat in the world -- it &apos;s not just like a bi@@ os@@ se@@ um .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-31.745340): he was a member of the size of my wife , and he was born with a farmer .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.324760): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.574965): the first idea was a fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-23.739809): and then it was clear that it doesn &apos;t help us to help the bees .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .

Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-10.046187): I had a second idea . I did a cow .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-25.052963): I wanted to be the first person I was wearing a cheese sandwich .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-9.243963): but there are very smart creatures .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-47.605442): you see the walk , and you go to the other side , and you see that the guy &apos;s going to go and go back and see it .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-9.382113): and they take the soil .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.381531): I was a little guy sitting on the left , and I was walking down to the road , and I was walking down to the road .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-12.174912): so fear is a road .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.553415): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-61.576046): and I was a little kid in the summer , and I started getting a little kid , and I started to get a lot of my kids , and I was going to go back to the computer .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-47.657291): I took a high @-@ powered car , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and you can see a blue @-@ off @-@ the @-@ shelf .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-23.767038): I was sent to a car , and I want to give up the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-6.572737): this is a little black box .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-4.336971): and then I built all together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-26.225916): the solar is a battery that takes the battery to the solar system .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-8.112188): and the virtual sphere .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-18.086781): you can see the ra@@ ils that are coming out of the street .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-10.417177): so this is what happens to the lions .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-27.118589): the blind is the panic , and I can see the lights in the morning .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.025323): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-26.576439): I &apos;ve been doing this for dinner , and we have no longer been in the United States .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-6.332507): and then we left our neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-3.292716): one of them was a grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-33.806286): she was threatened to see her arms , and she was able to see why they were in the morning .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.698711): and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-13.800447): I have the lights . you can see the balls .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-41.507980): I &apos;ve been living in the house with seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ day @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ make @-@ go @-@ up .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-68.798317): now , it &apos;s a very good thing to do , because it &apos;s not used to be used to be a lot of food , but it &apos;s used to be used to be the most vulnerable .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
