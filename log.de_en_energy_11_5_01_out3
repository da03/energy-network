Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-97.214516): and what I &apos;m doing is that in Afghanistan , is that the most important thing is that the president is doing a report , and that is a result of what they do is that they &apos;re going to be a very successful act of being a girl .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-21.970173): that means that our leader can &apos;t be paid in a good way .

Predicted (-88.331177): they &apos;re often asked to be in the case of the most successful , and in fact , in fact , they are in a way of the marriage of the community , and they &apos;re not going to be able to talk about the American .

Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-70.310081): because I &apos;m in school , when I &apos;m in school , I can teach them to go to the community , and then I can take care of them , and then they &apos;re going to be able to go to the school .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .

Ground Truth: that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
Predicted (-42.789413): I was so excited about my work , and I was talking about the people who had been doing this , and I was really excited about the media .
Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .

Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-23.632496): we have a fantastic passion to help the technology and the government of the world .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-75.169662): our social scientists are responsible for the fact that we &apos;re in our health and health and health , and I think that there &apos;s no reason to talk about how to deal with the power of our technology , and it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-27.733011): but the amazing thing is that our colleagues are not going to happen to be a lot of our governments .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-15.573548): so scientists , engineers , and I &apos;m going to do it .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-42.332596): I &apos;ll show you a couple of examples , which is what we can do , and I think you can see that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of science .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-18.373436): the first question that you have to do is , and they &apos;re like , right ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-16.862484): now , you know , this is a global basis for what &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-107.134682): they don &apos;t tell us that they &apos;re just going to be a bit more like this , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to be able to do that , and they &apos;re actually using these neuro@@ modul@@ ators and then they &apos;re going to be able to understand that they &apos;re going to be a bit more complex .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-20.268192): and what you do is that you make it a bit more attractive .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-12.696003): there &apos;s a key to understanding .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-58.319489): now , &quot; You know , &quot; Please help me , &quot; but not for the time , &quot; and then you have a sense of time , &quot; Hey , what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-24.657490): you don &apos;t understand what the quality of your mind is to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-22.616463): Einstein said that the way that &apos;s done , but it &apos;s not possible .
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-33.709496): you can tell us a lot of un@@ prepared to do with a thousand of these things .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-53.126675): there &apos;s some things that are going to be a few things about these things , and then you can see that we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-19.844677): and if you have your work , you can get the credit .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-17.884617): now you have to ask yourself what &apos;s called &quot; Re@@ al ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-37.400101): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a conversation , and then you get it into your pocket .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-34.906441): so this is not a little bit like this , but it &apos;s actually a very close @-@ to @-@ up gap .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-86.503326): so , this is a fascinating aspect of the evolution of the I@@ I@@ I@@ I@@ I@@ I@@ I@@ though is a very important part of the process that it &apos;s so much more important than the visual structure of the sky .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-106.770630): one is the only one that &apos;s the only way that I can use a computer to do it , and it &apos;s a little bit more than the fact that it &apos;s going to be able to do with the use of the speech , and that &apos;s what it means is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-32.532326): so there &apos;s some of these guys who are trying to go to the open @-@ up , and that &apos;s what the engineers can see .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .

Predicted (-9.377813): but you know , like a African party ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-1.630275): AB : seven .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-40.617218): you know , it &apos;s all like the guy who &apos;s going to be on the front of these giant chicken .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-59.421650): so the third one has been lost , and the rest of the country is not so much , because you have to say that the president is in the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-9.008315): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-46.255150): the ideas are to try to change the reality , and to change the reality of the words , not only the same as a language .

Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.094548): thank you very much .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .

Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-89.868759): I was a little girl named the N@@ op@@ o@@ x of the mine , and I had a little bit of a di@@ re @-@ held fire@@ , and he &apos;s not going to be able to do that .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-3.059311): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-159.961426): and for me , there was a long time for a long time , a long time of the American women who were sitting in the back@@ side of the world , and we were able to go to the old @-@ fashioned and @-@ go @-@ to @-@ school school , and to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ home , and we have a little bit of the same thing that I had to do with the same thing .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-8.002874): but that &apos;s the self @-@ expression .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-89.950905): so here I &apos;m a Muslim @-@ lived , the state of the West , and the Jewish Jewish community , in the &apos; 60s , with a war of the world , and it &apos;s a pro@@ pen@@ sity for peace .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-144.161713): now , there &apos;s a great thing to do with these beautiful things , and I can &apos;t tell you that there &apos;s a kind of a kind of a great @-@ story , but I can try to find out that the way that the world is to do with the magic and to make it a little bit more difficult to do that , and to try to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-101.069946): I have a day to live in a new country called &quot; The Mon@@ al &quot; and &quot; a great deal of the crime of the war , &quot; and why it &apos;s a mis@@ mis@@ mis@@ use of religious peace@@ writing .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-54.280834): and what the translator can do is do to do with a foreign campaign , and I &apos;ll do that , &quot; I &apos;m going to do a campaign . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-41.767639): and to try to do this , to create the company that &apos;s not using the bur@@ gl@@ ings of the time .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-127.309135): I &apos;m going to talk about a car in the world where the police are going to take a little bit of the money , and they &apos;re going to be able to take a look at the streets of the police and the police department , and they &apos;re going to give them a little bit of a few more than a few dollars .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-28.595167): I think that in my opinion , the conflict of Afghanistan is going to be a post @-@ conflict .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-162.157623): the rab@@ bi has been able to do this , and then it &apos;s a way to do that , in a way , you can take a long @-@ term , and you can use a new kind of thing to do with the bot@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ an@@ ical , and then you can put it in a few days of the city , and then you can actually have a pro@@ pen@@ sity to do that .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-143.523483): and I can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a kind of like &quot; The W@@ ig@@ ig@@ u@@ f &quot; -- &quot; the way that the National Security Council is to take a look at the time of the National Science Foundation is to take a little bit of a man to take a little bit of a man and to talk about about the world .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-23.211765): but for all these things , you can go into them , you can get them wrong .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-17.070625): but I do it because it &apos;s the way we need to hide the self .

Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-6.214660): that &apos;s my input .

Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-4.524511): 10 years ago ,
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-46.479774): I mean , this is a sense of being in a room that I &apos;ve been able to put up a little bit of a secret .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-11.116880): I have a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-35.469112): this is the first time you get to the TED Talk , and you can see that I &apos;m going to get a happy person .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-31.454220): and I have a lot of people , because I &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re going to do it .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-35.749092): I &apos;m actually in a very difficult position , because I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit more difficult than I can tell you about that .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-7.905328): no one has to do that .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-26.575161): they &apos;re very silly , because I &apos;m not sure they &apos;re all supposed to be .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-37.380829): the key is that I &apos;m going to do a little bit of a bad thing , because I &apos;m going to tell you about your head .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.518760): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.602084): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-2.998959): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-16.872818): now , I was not sure that this was like a moment .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-13.274332): so , a symbol is a remarkable thing .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.575798): I &apos;ve been able to do this in every five seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-17.586861): and this is the moment I had a real --
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-31.206055): I was very proud of my dad , and I was trying to put his glasses on the side of the mountain .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-107.686630): and at the time , the A@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ ting , it &apos;s a little bit of time to make it a little bit more difficult than that , and I think that it &apos;s not only in our lives .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-10.658401): it &apos;s too difficult to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-6.053542): I &apos;m sitting on this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-28.357861): I &apos;m on the side of this , because I &apos;m a young girl , and I &apos;m a good man .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-34.431046): I &apos;m going to ask the question that people are now to ask , and I think , the more people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.782207): the first question is , how do you do ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.852633): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been saying that .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-47.581741): the reason I think that the public is a kind of a brand @-@ like version of this , and it &apos;s a great example of what they &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-84.069023): now , in some of us , we have a very good part of the beauty of the universe , and it &apos;s very , very difficult to find a little bit more like a meat and a non @-@ verbal , and so on .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-17.374916): this is a legacy for me , and it &apos;s a legacy for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-53.079681): there &apos;s a very good audience . I think that there &apos;s a lot of people who are in the morning , and it &apos;s like &quot; A@@ gri@@ an . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-15.847924): and then I &apos;m going to show you a very , very impressive .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-122.956573): but I &apos;ve shown you that in the last four years , in the &apos; 60s , the student of the I@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ C@@ ab@@ ati , and that &apos;s the only one that has been able to do it , but it &apos;s a lot of the most sophisticated use of the use of the time .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-15.518857): the next question is , I &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; What can I do ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-12.465175): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t really know what to do .
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-17.230137): but the second one I want to do is , &quot; Why are there a little girl ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-3.793466): you know what ? you can .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-78.833023): you can have the U.S. or the American person in the world , and the one of the most successful , the word is going to be a ven@@ der , and I &apos;m going to have a bad idea .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-48.317070): so , when you &apos;re talking about this , it &apos;s not going to be a big fan , I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not going to be a pilot . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-64.188492): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , and it &apos;s not a good one for the most important reason to go to the American and the M@@ .D. / P@@ .@@ R. .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-45.675919): so , you know , if you want to do something like that , you &apos;ll have to say that you &apos;re going to be a bit more like a lottery .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-13.528555): it can &apos;t be solved , and it &apos;s not true .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-29.289227): now I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s possible to have a better impact .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-153.537567): there &apos;s a little man who &apos;s sitting there , and then you can see that the camera is going to be here , and then you &apos;re going to see that the first one is going to be a little bit like a man , and then you &apos;re going to go back and see that the next one is , and then you have to take a piece of the old piece of paper that &apos;s gone .
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-5.815739): it &apos;s about that .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-9.038205): sometimes this is a little bit more like this .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-12.168198): I was like , &quot; Oh , I don &apos;t know what happened .
Predicted (-95.159187): so , a school bank has a little bit more , and it &apos;s not going to be a few minutes , but when you go to school , you can say , &quot; You know , you can go to the bank , and you &apos;ll get a little bit of the bank .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-14.091312): so the question is , &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-29.902935): now , these are probably not all the same , but it &apos;s a little bit of a game .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-44.255138): this is the first one that I did . I was a guy who was doing this , and I was actually going to be a little bit old .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
Predicted (-14.705871): now , I know that &apos;s a really good one .
Ground Truth: this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .

Ground Truth: and I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
Predicted (-6.061429): and I hope you &apos;ll see these pictures .
Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .

Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-16.208031): now , the next thing you ask yourself , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-80.980507): I have a number of guys who are in the three @-@ day , but I don &apos;t have a lot of fun to do it , and I &apos;m going to be able to do things that are the most non @-@ zero @-@ sum , because I can do things .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
Predicted (-37.893700): I went to a school in Chicago , and I got a good school , and I got to get a shower and I bought all the money .
Ground Truth: when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
Predicted (-99.535004): when I was a kid , I was a very shy , and I got a bad news , and I got a phone call , and I &apos;d never know that she was going to go back and go , and we got a little bit of a ra@@ cist .
Ground Truth: and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
Predicted (-53.741196): I have no difference in this experience , and I can tell you that there &apos;s no amount of attention to the people who are in their lives , and they &apos;re not paying attention .
Ground Truth: I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
Predicted (-41.321690): I live in New York , and the most high @-@ income people in the South Bronx , and they were killed by about 20 years ago .
Ground Truth: and there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-41.716091): it &apos;s about 12 @-@ year @-@ old New York , and the homeless woman is not about to be the pre@@ occupied .
Src: sondern : &quot; wie oft werde ich angehalten ? wann werde ich angehalten ? &quot;
Ground Truth: but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-7.406691): but how often do I go ? &quot;
Ground Truth: when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
Predicted (-76.176208): and I learned that my research on this line is that if you were at the end of the four @-@ year @-@ old women , they were not going to be able to do that in the United States , and they &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Src: die letzte Frage an mich lautet : &quot; wie ist es , ein Model zu sein ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;

Predicted (-84.028496): so , of course , this is a moment of time , because it &apos;s a little bit like this , and you can see that the speed of the screen is going to be able to do this , but it &apos;s a little bit more than the speed of the human mind .

Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-13.223697): no , Coca @-@ Cola has been on this research .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-14.377561): so in this movie , I &apos;m going to show you a lot of fun .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-45.627758): so , the next piece of a magnetic field , which is called a magnetic field that &apos;s going to turn into the box .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-24.657021): and it &apos;s a little bit of the water coming out of the table .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-36.566696): the most surprising one is that the neuron has come up with a lot of the extra .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-23.385406): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that &apos;s going to be filled with a glass .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-71.420845): the walls are coming up in the area , and the amount of sound is that they &apos;re coming out of the walls , and they &apos;re going to be in the front of the front of the boxes .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-89.953491): so if you have a video of the first time , and you have to see the ball of the screen , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the time , and then you can see the amount of time that &apos;s going to go to the next 10 years .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-7.008659): a week , a third one .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-18.122007): this is a very boring movie -- a little bit of a human .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-16.345005): and what does it live with a little bit of excitement ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-31.409575): you can see the same thing , and the rivers come up with the walls and the bottom .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-10.692390): it &apos;s like a rock in a shoe .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-67.414024): and I thought that it was just like this , because it &apos;s just a picture of a human being , and it &apos;s actually not just taken a picture of a li@@ f@@ us .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-60.303352): but if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit more , and if you have to be able to keep the dark , it &apos;s going to be able to keep the light .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-59.196541): this is why the light is that it &apos;s a little bit of a stick and then it &apos;s going to take the nectar and get out of the flower .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-67.810410): so , in the next example , if you can put a camera in the room , it &apos;s a place where you can actually get into the piano , and you can see it in a box where it &apos;s going to be safe .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-11.338010): so , my team at MIT has built ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-97.425659): now , if you have a very brief night , you can see that you have a little bit of time , and you have a little bit of a time that &apos;s not going to be able to do it , and you have a little bit more than a time to do that .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-109.644554): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to take this video , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of the data that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we &apos;re going to use this amazing , and we can see this kind of thing that &apos;s going to be done .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-19.567627): and we can use all these data and start to get the kind of thing .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-10.048788): so , Sylvia is too .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-53.784653): voice : these are beautiful creatures that can lead to a new world , and perhaps , as a way of looking for a cur@@ able creature ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-13.963841): the idea is that we &apos;re going to get light out .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-67.167862): it &apos;s going to be thrown out in the center of the door , and then you can see that the door is going to be in the back of the room , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the camera .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-11.590549): this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve actually got it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.431792): and you see the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-27.863400): and the wall is behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to have a light on the door .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-67.561745): the idea of being published in the book was made by a plastic , and it &apos;s been made of the fact that it &apos;s been done in the visualization of these technologies .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-136.511688): they &apos;re going to be able to make these blue dots , and then we &apos;re going to see the light that &apos;s going to be taken into the ears and the sound of the light , and then you can see that every single one of these three @-@ dimensional , and then it &apos;s going to be a little bit more and more than a half of the time that &apos;s going to be taken .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-24.826332): and so we have a camera that &apos;s actually a camera -- it &apos;s very close to our camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-18.643974): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s a very good time in the world .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-54.927914): so , we know that the presence of the time , but it &apos;s not the point of the connection to the outside , and it &apos;s not what we want to be .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-108.173828): if we &apos;re going to show a laser , we can see a little bit of a film that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and then we can see that the sound of the screen , and then we can see that the camera is going to be able to make a little bit more interesting , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-4.447427): can we go into 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.449547): so here &apos;s the I@@ RA .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-133.344528): we have to do this , and we have to do a little bit of a few years ago , where we can see the right thing , and then we can see that if we can take the right @-@ hand @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ the @-@ hand interface , and we can see that we can go out to the outside of the system , and then take it to the nervous system .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-114.096985): and because of the de@@ code is so powerful , and it &apos;s also a kind of exciting tool that we can actually take a long time to take a look at the fact that it &apos;s a great @-@ time @-@ to @-@ the @-@ head @-@ to @-@ the @-@ one @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old , and it &apos;s a tool .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-141.039124): so , as an artist , in fact , in fact , is that we have a great science fiction fiction , and it &apos;s a very , very simple , but it &apos;s a time that we can see that all of these images , and it &apos;s a four @-@ year @-@ old video that we &apos;ve made in the history of the world , and that &apos;s not only a lot of the time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-6.753910): but there &apos;s something really interesting .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-27.678501): if you look at this red line , you &apos;ll see the waves of the snow coming out .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-6.332506): the waves should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.688171): what &apos;s happening ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-56.973537): it &apos;s actually going to be out of the ocean , and we would have to see that this kind of thing , like , in fact , that &apos;s a very nice thing .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-61.804001): in the past , in the context of the moment , it &apos;s been shown in the center of the sphere , and it &apos;s not possible to put in a position of the memory .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-160.151459): instead of giving us a new tool , it &apos;s not just about the creation of our imagination and the creation of all the time , and the tools of the world , the knowledge of the world , the most important things that we can take out of the scientific and the use of the pro@@ creation of our collection , and we can take out of the back of the back and go to the library .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-3.964531): it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-7.399494): there are many ways of changing our own lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-36.733334): you don &apos;t have a street in the world , because we don &apos;t know how to make the li@@ f@@ ings .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .

Ground Truth: how can we l@@ end and borrow more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
Predicted (-21.372414): we can make things more like a free @-@ to @-@ no @-@ let .
Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-26.332106): how can we take our imagination into the living and the building of the world ?
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-32.614391): how can we create our homes and our own community to create these beautiful dreams .

Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-66.078545): so , in a form of a large , a broad component , and it &apos;s a very specific component of the knowledge that has been used to be a major component .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-51.594845): now , the mis@@ sil@@ ks are so incredibly important for this , and it &apos;s a very good way to do that .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-17.189054): and so , in many years , we &apos;ve been able to do this .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-127.606331): there are still two women who are living in the world , and with the long @-@ term , to have the ability to do that , to have the disease that we have to do with the disease , and the more we have to do that , to try to save the death of the disease , and to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-68.896767): we can do the ability to do it , and we can only have to do it in the right direction , and that &apos;s the only way we can find that there &apos;s a real time to be a problem .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-98.791435): so , in fact , there &apos;s a lot of pain , and it &apos;s also a good thing for the patients , and you can see that there &apos;s no real @-@ time @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ hand @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ there @-@ a @-@ of @-@ the @-@ box .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-33.981106): it &apos;s done to be a hospital , and it &apos;s done . it &apos;s a hospital that has no interest .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-14.478464): but what if patients were going to take a test ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-35.037434): this is a hospital that could take away from the hospital , and then they would do what to do .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-11.833821): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-15.479886): it &apos;s about 250 dollars to make a drug .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-49.581612): so I want to do something that &apos;s very useful to do , because we &apos;re trying to do something that is in the present way we do this .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-16.419666): here &apos;s a video where you see the sound of a rubber band .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-91.971466): so , in a sense , it &apos;s a common sense of what we call &quot; the baby , &quot; and we &apos;re going to have a lot of mis@@ use , because we &apos;re going to have the same mis@@ conception of neurons , and we can do that .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-14.852313): and we &apos;re doing a practice of it .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-17.709370): think about it , for a long time , you know , it &apos;s a kid .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-69.753891): so , by the way , you can see the li@@ li@@ li@@ ars , and you can see the li@@ li@@ li@@ ars , so that the sound is going to be like a hormone .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-15.504913): on the left , you can see a rubber band .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-2.958041): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-21.444305): voice , a moral , un@@ desirable .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-29.750626): the person is actually playing with a speech and it &apos;s actually a more and more fun .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-148.040268): so , the ability to do this is to be a piece of video , and it &apos;s a kind of de@@ par@@ able , but it &apos;s a good @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ go @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand , because it &apos;s a multi @-@ touch connection , and it &apos;s a lot of time that &apos;s been used to be able to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-41.758636): so , if you can do this , you can see , in fact , are the clinical trials , they &apos;re not at least clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-11.196549): so , the infrastructure is very .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-9.074700): you have no need to build a new factory .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-5.573150): and they &apos;re both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.272398): so they can be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-6.446238): they &apos;re very , very fast .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-7.924615): they &apos;re very cheap , and we know what this is .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-21.770573): so , if you &apos;re a very cheap , it &apos;s actually a lot of things .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-11.257475): so these are the goals that we can do .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-11.098878): we can help the severe health .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-21.778137): patients have no license to do the cost of a cup of coffee .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-17.830128): we can use the data to restore planetary .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.009964): we can use the same @-@ effective treatment for the first time to study these kinds of technologies .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-25.403490): now we have the first time to explore the microbial community , to find out the disease of the time .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-23.133762): now we &apos;re going to do this now , we &apos;re going to start the right @-@ hand interface .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-68.307549): and I have a live @-@ up @-@ up , with a number of people on the left , and we have to have a full @-@ time to @-@ to @-@ peer @-@ to @-@ peer framework .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-29.500853): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and the half of the planet is about 100 percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-85.938850): or a video , with a hand@@ bag , you can do it , with a four @-@ minute , we can have a four @-@ year @-@ old , and we have to do that for a while , we &apos;re not able to do that .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.027728): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-21.223627): if we take a sample of thousands of people , you can tell them what they &apos;re going to be healthy .
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.803634): what are you going to do with these all of them ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-24.832336): so what happens is that the patient &apos;s attention to the patient &apos;s level of control .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-12.108416): maybe you &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-50.186432): there &apos;s a huge variety of different sources of information , because we &apos;re interested in what these are are the most important ones that are in the field of visual areas .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-16.499691): now , the average of them is 0.@@ 5 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-4.331427): it &apos;s a good thing .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-66.575958): my father &apos;s work , and I was able to show that it &apos;s not a great thing , because it &apos;s so important for us to do this -- it &apos;s a fantastic thing to do with the Internet .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-4.427059): this is what I call .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-70.373772): the person can show up , and you can see the phone , and then you can get the phone , and then you can get the phone , and you can get the attention to the people who can do this .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-0.734941): right .

Ground Truth: thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Predicted (-2.745521): thank you very much . ladies and gentlemen .
Src: danke , Tom .
Ground Truth: thanks , Tom .
Predicted (-0.708703): thank you .
Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-10.455885): I live here in the mountains of Nairobi .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-36.034302): and the father &apos;s sitting here on the left of the shoe and the Bronx is a far@@ m@@ on .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-41.228584): the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very protected area where the ocean is .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-17.359779): the queen , they are taking the names .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-2.198794): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-30.807032): this is one of my father , and every night , I was in the morning , and she was dead .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-54.893387): the tribe of the forest is called the sacred , and the elephant , and we all have to come up with the animals that we have to do .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-8.337833): I had a child to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-27.303234): our soldiers are called the O@@ il and the O@@ il .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-2.795061): and kill lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-13.992232): here &apos;s a woman who was running in Nepal .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-32.981884): and I think there &apos;s a big threat in the world -- it &apos;s not just like a few pro@@ bes .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-31.742306): he was a member of the size of my wife , and he was born with a farmer .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.014826): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.374279): the first idea was a fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-23.119087): and then I realized that it &apos;s not going to help us understand what the bees might be .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-5.020070): I didn &apos;t have .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-9.659644): I had a second idea . I did a cow .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-25.204144): I wanted to be the first person I was wearing a cheese sandwich .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-7.916649): but females are very smart .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-46.467926): you see the walk , and you go to the other side , and you see that the guy &apos;s going to go and go back and see it .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-9.120815): and they take the soil .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-49.411713): I was walking down at the moment , and I was walking down to the street , and I was just taking a shot of the guy .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-12.820435): so fear is a road .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.448377): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-88.723969): and I was a little kid in the summer , and I started getting a little kid , and I started to get a lot of my kids , and I started to see that the entire computer was going to be used to be a little bit of the fire .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-39.702892): I took a high @-@ powered car , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and you can see the blue line .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-23.517281): I was sent to a car , and I want to give up the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-6.760507): this is a little black box .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-3.959365): and then I built all together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-32.888947): the solar takes the battery to the battery , and it &apos;s a 3D printer that allows you to go .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-13.959639): and the virtual sphere is a light .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-17.039139): you can see the ra@@ fts that are coming out of the ocean .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-9.899291): so this is what happens to the lions .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-26.789543): the blind is the panic , and I can see the lights in the morning .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.027728): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-23.759192): I &apos;ve been doing this for home and we had no food in the past .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-5.902363): and then we left our neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.972316): one of them was a grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-36.560028): she had been threatened to see all these animals , and she was able to see why they were in front of us .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.522129): and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-13.418745): I mean , we can put the lights on the screen .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-41.716415): I &apos;ve been living in the house with seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hand @-@ up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand @-@ making .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-68.890068): now , it &apos;s a very good thing to do , because it &apos;s not used to be used to be a lot of food , but it &apos;s used to be used to be the most vulnerable .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .
Ground Truth: because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
Predicted (-48.984650): a job of a school that I was working on to be a nonprofit fund , and I &apos;m going to show you a very high school .
Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-20.045219): my new education is to help and help the private sector .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-66.257668): I have a home with my friends and I &apos;m still looking at the store , and we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and I &apos;ll give you the people to see where they &apos;re doing it .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-64.122002): now , one of my first time , I was a little boy from a father , and he was sitting in a little town of mine , and I said , &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to go back . &quot;
Src: und hier stehe ich nun .
Ground Truth: and here I am today .

Ground Truth: so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
Predicted (-17.245995): I &apos;m going to be a big pilot , and I &apos;m going to be a designer .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-71.525230): and I &apos;ve been able to do that , because I can &apos;t do it , and I can go to the heart of the day , and I can &apos;t have a message to the people .
Predicted (-23.318228): O@@ MA : I have a very good name .
Ground Truth: you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .

Ground Truth: my next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
Predicted (-17.128304): so , my first piece of design is a magnetic field .
Ground Truth: but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
Predicted (-19.371132): yes , I have a nuclear weapon , but I have all kinds of cool things .
