when I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; the Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; you can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
a morning that I will never forget .
a real school .
you see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
so for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to esc@@ ort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
it was co@@ zy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were ris@@ king our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and daughters were treas@@ ured .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
a total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ owned by his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
and my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
during Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
so do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ leb@@ ury College .
when I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educate his daughters , was among the first to congrat@@ ulate me .
he not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
my family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educate women .
that &apos;s why I co@@ founded Sol@@ a , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
and I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
like Ahmed . that &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from Sol@@ a to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a road@@ side bomb by minutes .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
