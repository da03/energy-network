Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .

Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-21.261101): that means that our men are not going to be taught in our own success .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-71.622673): they &apos;re often given to them , and they are in the case of the fact that there are a woman who is in their own opinion , and they are in the future of the workforce .

Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-85.628799): because when I go to school , I can teach them to the students , and when they go to the school , I can take care of them , and then they &apos;re going to be able to see the potential of a young , a kind of self @-@ interest .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .

Predicted (-88.391121): we were in the South Bronx , and we found this in the South Bronx , which is a place called the Ar@@ u@@ i , which is the only place in the United States , with the food chain .
Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .

Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-68.696480): and most of our technology is that we have to talk about health and health and health , and when we talk about it , we don &apos;t know how to solve it , because it &apos;s a problem of physics , and it &apos;s a lot of people .

Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-25.378342): and you know , what &apos;s going on for us is that this is a significant way of doing .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-94.040321): they don &apos;t tell us that they &apos;re going to be able to use their own , because they &apos;re actually going to be a very interesting , and that &apos;s what we call the pro@@ pen@@ sive process of being able to see their behavior .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .

Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .

Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-48.093437): so this is not a little bit like the speed of attention , and it &apos;s actually a very important part of the brain that we &apos;re going to be able to keep up .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-82.564522): and the Di@@ ver is a very important aspect of the fact that the museum is that it &apos;s a very common place that we have to be able to see the potential of the E@@ qu@@ an .

Predicted (-337.699371): and they decided to say that , instead of talking about the Internet , it was not just the same thing that we &apos;ve been talking about , because it was the case of the American , the fact that the world has been used to be able to be able to read in the in@@ cur@@ ate , and that the non @-@ zero @-@ sum of the world , but the in@@ adver@@ t@@ ents of the United States , the in@@ ts that we have been used to the in@@ ity of the in@@ ity , the in@@ ts that we were in@@ ts that were used to the United States , and the law that they were able to have to the in@@ ity Act al al scrip@@ ting , and the law enforcement they were going to the in@@ scrip@@ ting it was used to
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.646932): you can see some of the three things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-55.583843): and the first thing I do is I can &apos;t even have to talk about -- because it &apos;s the most important thing that I could have to call the H@@ ut@@ able .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-45.291901): Al Gore : there &apos;s only one that &apos;s going to be a president of the United States , and it &apos;s going to be used to do it .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-45.430233): if you think that a scientist can do something , then it &apos;s going to be a very important thing , and then it &apos;s going to be done after a month .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-45.153954): and the third thing is , is that the most important thing that we have to talk about is that the West , the United States , or the president of the United States , right ?
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-58.310711): what you &apos;ve got to do is take a little bit of the oil @-@ sized and the largest micro@@ credit , and it &apos;s a great one of the most sophisticated vehicles .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-14.049261): and I have a story of the size of that .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-11.542511): so , the winner of the win .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-8.722158): you have a gay agenda .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-33.312935): and the other one of the greatest things that we &apos;ve been doing , is , of course , is what it was .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-10.943352): but you know , how many nations have a national attack ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-0.974929): AB : seven .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-52.739426): and you know , it &apos;s like all the way that the guy &apos;s license , or the gri@@ ds of the oil .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-73.305183): and the wa@@ kes of the day , because the president is told that it &apos;s not going to be a woman who &apos;s lost in the United States , and it &apos;s going to be a free @-@ win .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-22.052990): and the thing is , you can do the most important thing , and I can take you off .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-50.792164): students have to understand the definition of the brain , and sometimes to change the reality , and the reality is not just the same as a form of words .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.774661): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-47.833244): so I went to a place in the United States , and it was about a 50 @-@ year @-@ old , a @-@ old man named Har@@ ali .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-66.013657): I was wearing a little @-@ inch ra@@ ining and a half @-@ pound s@@ uns@@ ur@@ d , and I couldn &apos;t see the power of a drum .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-3.740508): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-138.999237): and after that , I was working with a long time for a long time , and we had a big @-@ lived family in the United States , and we had to talk about the K@@ hu@@ i , the K@@ ig@@ i , who had been able to take care of the world and to the most vulnerable , and to the United States .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-6.904905): but that is the self @-@ organizing .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-78.667328): so , I &apos;m looking at the Middle East , and there are a Muslim @-@ state of a country called N@@ ile , the United States , and a great @-@ term , working with a long @-@ term .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-123.206078): and there &apos;s a lot of great things that I can &apos;t do with them , but I can teach them to be able to find out that art and art is to create a world of the most beautiful , and to try to make sure that the most important thing is that we can &apos;t take a look at the center of the world .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-73.179703): I want to leave a day with a &quot; Star Wars &quot; in the world , &quot; which is a lot of political violence , &quot; and they have to fight against the my@@ stic ,
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-54.984009): but what the heck could be doing is , &quot; Well , I can do a campaign with the president of the country , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , let &apos;s do it . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-37.633514): and to try to create this , to try to make the pro@@ pen@@ cils that are using the war .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-131.348923): I &apos;m going to talk to a global economy , and it &apos;s going to be a place where the police are in the United States , and they &apos;re going to give us a sign of paper , and they &apos;re going to be able to use the money , and they &apos;re going to take a little bit of a man who &apos;s not going to take care of the food supply of the streets .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-25.325315): I think I would like to ask myself in the Middle East , which is a conflict of Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-159.595215): and the other thing that we &apos;ve been able to do is to create a culture that &apos;s been used to bring up the ground in a long time , and it &apos;s a pro@@ ver@@ sa@@ c , and it &apos;s called &quot; The Un@@ cle , &quot; with a single @-@ term , a @-@ American @-@ hand , &quot; which is a place for a thousand @-@ dollar @-@ art .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-140.566452): and I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , this is a kind of a kind of like a little bit of a global ethic that can be used to take the back of the United States , and it &apos;s about to be able to use the fact that there &apos;s a way that we can bring up to the post @-@ war in the United States to the world of the world . &quot;
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-24.394583): but for all of these things , you can be able to do things , you can &apos;t be trained .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-18.693165): but I do it because I have to use it to be the opposite of the self .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-9.795376): that &apos;s my height . what is your ?
Ground Truth: thank you .

Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-23.196800): Hi . my name is &quot; <blank> tically &quot; as a construction process .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-10.210487): 10 years ago , I was doing exactly .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-51.539268): I mean , this has been a sense of being a little bit in the middle of the room , but I would have been able to make it a secret .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-12.277278): fortunately , I &apos;ve got one thing to do with a little bit .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-41.571716): this is the first time that you &apos;re going to get to TED , and I think it &apos;s a little bit like you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-54.119606): and if I have a lot of people , I &apos;m really sure that they &apos;re going to do it , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll just wait for the month .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-29.240738): I &apos;m actually sure that it &apos;s very difficult to see in a few minutes , because I think it &apos;s going to be different .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-13.308699): it &apos;s not the one that has to do .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-24.750172): the number of things are very uncomfortable , because they don &apos;t like to be there .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-44.491508): the key to my mind is that when I get to the ears , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s going to be more than anything you &apos;re doing .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.998680): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-2.899985): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-3.955757): and that was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-13.158269): and I certainly decided that it was not like this .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-33.933960): a powerful object is that it &apos;s a bit like this , but it &apos;s a very controversial thing .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-15.491370): I &apos;ve been able to focus all over the last six seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-17.977827): and this is what I did in a moment -- I didn &apos;t have a friend .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-42.977562): and I was very proud of the way that I was going to see my grandmother , and I put them in the front of the box .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-106.082657): and when the F@@ M @-@ 3 @-@ hour period of time , it &apos;s not just a little bit of time , it &apos;s a sense that we &apos;ve been able to use our life to be able to get into the most sophisticated and to do something that &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-18.017487): and I &apos;m going to be very happy to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-7.895551): and I &apos;m standing on this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-39.105484): I &apos;m standing in this side , because I &apos;m a nice lady , and I love this girl , and we &apos;re in a nuclear weapon .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-25.241886): I &apos;ll ask the question , and I &apos;m going to ask you to ask the question of people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-7.572398): the first question is , how do you get a model ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.083196): I said , &quot; Well , I think it &apos;s all gone . &quot;
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-42.739269): the reason I think that the national competition is , like , is a symbol of a brand , and it &apos;s a kind of important proposition .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-89.549362): but most of us have been able to see the beauty of the universe , and we &apos;re also very proud of being a very , very , very difficult , to see that we &apos;re using sex and de@@ x@@ ing , and so on .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-20.153936): this is a legacy for me , and it &apos;s a wonderful part of the workforce .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-86.123573): there &apos;s a truth . I think , you know , there are some people who are like to be a good , like , and I &apos;m going to be a ma@@ x@@ a@@ v , and there &apos;s a po@@ dium of ra@@ ils .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-18.791889): and then , I want to show you a very , very impressive application .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-114.398193): but I &apos;ve shown to you that in the first time , in fact , the first one of the four @-@ year @-@ olds , where the student was able to measure , or not only have a lot of the quality of the radio , but it &apos;s been able to be able to get rid of the D@@ M .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-18.094234): the next question I will say is , &quot; Well , if I &apos;m going to be able to do that ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-8.537039): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know that .
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-16.563305): but the second one I want to tell you is that these guys are not going to do .
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.323361): you know what ? you can .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-71.548523): you can go to the United States , and if you have a child , the most likely of the word , the word of the &quot; N@@ ope , &quot; and I &apos;m going to have a real @-@ time .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-46.684944): and when you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it , I say , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be like , &quot; This is a fantastic plan . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-58.919083): but I don &apos;t have to support it for you , because the CEO of the American , or the CEO of the M@@ .D. , or the two @-@ dimensional ,
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-45.786610): and you &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , if you want to be a game that &apos;s going to be told , you can actually get the ticket to the top .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-15.749672): it can &apos;t be invisible , and it &apos;s not a fantastic thing .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-41.851746): I want to show you a quick number of years , because the brain can be used to be a better @-@ based device .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-218.365387): there &apos;s a little bit of a snake , and when you see that , it &apos;s like , &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to take a piece of the sun , and then you can see the first one , and then you &apos;re going to take a piece of the robot , and then it &apos;s just going to be a piece of wood , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get it up to the right , and then , and then we have a little bit of the front of the back to get out of the front of the right , &quot; Let &apos;s get out of the front of it . &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .

Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-17.492416): and sometimes I think that &apos;s a little bit more than the right .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-11.987239): I was like , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what I didn &apos;t know .
Predicted (-86.182640): and a school has been doing a lot of fun , but if you &apos;re going to go , you can &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s going to be a school , it &apos;s going to be a lot of the most expensive , and it &apos;s going to be in the United States .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-34.494362): the question is , &quot; How many of you will be doing is they &apos;re going to run out of the web . &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .

Predicted (-50.748287): but I &apos;ve started to talk about the meaning of the music , and I have to tell you that it &apos;s not about the ability of communication , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-41.195778): the beauty of the activity is that we see , and it &apos;s not important to us , because there &apos;s a certain point of view .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-23.713741): it means that even one of the other things is going to be a kind of cl@@ oning .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-44.909607): and I would like to talk to you about a single @-@ word , and that &apos;s what you should be able to do , and it &apos;s not going to be so close to it .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-3.226023): you can be surprised .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-64.679321): but if we are not the only thing that we have , there &apos;s a gift that we have to be , and we have a very , very , very , very important message to the heart of every single individual .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-33.528214): the progress in the moment , and it &apos;s a change that we can do for people to go .
Src: bitte - sagen Sie mir nicht , dass ich normal bin .
Ground Truth: please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .

Ground Truth: Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet p@@ ier@@ cing through an apple , and exposure just a million@@ th of a second .
Predicted (-82.114235): Brian and Brian made a sense of being a little bit of a race , and it &apos;s been a complete picture of a six @-@ year @-@ old , and it &apos;s a half @-@ hour period of time .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-39.409988): but now , we &apos;re going to see that 50 billion dollars a year , and it &apos;s a half @-@ hour period of time , but we &apos;re going to see the world .

Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-58.897888): I &apos;ll show you a video of a new type of movement that &apos;s been able to capture the amount of light that &apos;s been used in time , and it &apos;s a great @-@ time process .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-64.279716): and we can take these cameras to see the space of our eyes , and we can just go back to the site , and see what it means to be , &quot; You know , I can &apos;t see a computer . &quot;
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-148.520294): and I &apos;ll take a laser , and if you &apos;re going to see a single @-@ scale , a single @-@ inch , it &apos;s a little bit of a multi @-@ dimensional , which is the only one that &apos;s going to be able to fly over the next two @-@ hour , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be able to be able to use the same energy , and the speed of the universe .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-50.103989): so , if you take this piece of tape , and you &apos;ll take the ice in the middle of the bottle , you &apos;ll get it into the oven ?

Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-4.670618): so , this whole event --
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-83.514084): so , it &apos;s a lot of time that you &apos;ve got to take the speed of light , but it &apos;s a little bit like this -- the speed of the Earth , and it &apos;s going to be able to take a little bit of the data that we &apos;ve been able to do .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .

Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-16.468454): so , in a lot of this film , I &apos;ll show you what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-44.077915): and what we call the E@@ R &amp; amp ; amp ; D , that &apos;s a piece of a balloon that starts to move .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-30.516668): and the one is about the wind , and you see the color of the ocean .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-28.594717): the number of people have been doing a lot of the extra dimensions .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-14.442467): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that goes through the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-68.064125): and the waves are coming out of the ground , and the color of the leaves are coming out of the mountain , and you can see that they &apos;re just going to be used for a few days .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-74.991562): and if you take a quick video , we have to take the same thing , and you can see the size of the clock , and we &apos;re going to go to the next 10 years , and you know , how much it &apos;s going to go to the moon .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-9.713619): a week , a child . no , all right ?
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-34.843800): this is a very boring film -- a little bit of the time , a very , very simple state .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-12.328367): and what about this is a life @-@ wandering ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-36.020817): you can see the waves , and they have the same waves in the background , and the walls of the park .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-16.449480): it &apos;s like if you &apos;re a rock , you have a stick .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-68.846375): and it would be like this , because it &apos;s also a picture of a human being , and that &apos;s what we call a picture of a whole , but it &apos;s also a very common wall .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-50.489304): but if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a little bit of the dark , you &apos;ll be able to see that the in@@ ert will be made .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-55.596169): why ? because this is the light that &apos;s going to take a stick and you get it out of the oven and then you get a little bit of a thousand .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-74.637604): so , if you &apos;re in the lab , you can see a camera in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s going to be able to take a piece of light that &apos;s available to you , and it &apos;s not going to be able to get it out .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-9.919321): so , how did the team take the MIT ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-84.857048): so , you know , if you &apos;ve been a few minutes , you can see a little bit of a massive record , and you &apos;ll see that it &apos;s not a big time for the sun , but it &apos;s going to be able to get a little bit of the light .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-83.437012): so , we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to use this new piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to see the same thing that we &apos;ve done with a massive , and it &apos;s going to be able to use these graphs .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.639969): and we can use all these data and start to see how much of these things are .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-7.499464): so , Evan is going to fly .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-42.478851): and other creatures can be wondering , how could it be a great way to make the world look like a single @-@ dimensional ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-9.737533): the idea is that we &apos;re going to light up .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-61.328461): it &apos;s going to be thrown out , and then you can see the door , and we &apos;re going to get the full of light that &apos;s going to be taken back to the center of the musical team .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-13.712644): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve actually got it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-11.641435): and you see the front of the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-25.463984): and the wall is behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to get the lights off .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-53.561710): when the book was written by the Science Foundation , it was made out of a lot of these things that we &apos;ve been able to read and write out .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-134.055984): and we &apos;re going to send these little strings into the box , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to see the ears , and then you &apos;re going to see that every single one of those three @-@ dimensional objects , and then the light that will be taken away from the air , and it &apos;s going to be made , and that &apos;s a constant signal that &apos;s going to be made .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-19.896515): and because we have a camera that &apos;s really very easy to have our camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.157700): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s going to be able to see the speed of light in the world .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-53.219955): and so we know that the air is not the ability to communicate , but it &apos;s the point that we have to be able to remember the point of view .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-123.003098): if we &apos;re going to see a laser , we can just show up the sound of a little bit of a box , and that &apos;s what we can see , and then we can see the images of the screen , but it &apos;s going to be able to make it happen to be a little bit of a piece of paper that &apos;s going to be made of the same thing .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-5.333982): can we get it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-9.177450): so here &apos;s the basis of our training .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-127.779716): we &apos;ve got to do something that we &apos;ve been able to see in the lab , and we can imagine that if we can take a little bit of a long @-@ term , and we can see the right @-@ hand , and we can go back to the center of the air , and we can see that it &apos;s going to be able to go out of the air , and go out of the computer .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-89.835579): and because of the tension , it &apos;s also a bit more important , and that &apos;s a tool that &apos;s going to be able to take a look at the first time , and it &apos;s a very important tool for the United States to actually have a new generation of science .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-114.467285): so , as a scientist , in fact , it &apos;s a science fiction film , and it &apos;s been a fantastic example of the history of the world , and it &apos;s been used to be able to measure all of the four @-@ dimensional space , and we can use it , and we can also see that it &apos;s not a lot of time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-13.583242): but there &apos;s something that &apos;s really going to be a funny thing .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-30.949402): and if you look at these waves , you &apos;ll see that the ice is going to be filled with the waves .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-6.034952): the obstacles should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.410545): what &apos;s happening here ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-38.628925): it &apos;s because we realized that there &apos;s a little bit of evidence that we could see in the same way , and it &apos;s very strange .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-59.651009): in the past , it &apos;s been shown in the same direction , in the context of the space , and it &apos;s not possible to put up the number of neurons in the field .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-151.837234): but if it &apos;s like to be able to use our own , it &apos;s been a kind of de@@ code , and we &apos;re going to use our own collection of data and the tools that we need to talk about in the past , and we have to be able to take the back of the world , and we &apos;re going to be able to use the scientific process of the entire history of the technology .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .

Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-7.653382): there are many ways of trying to improve our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-53.652473): we don &apos;t have any single person on the street , but we &apos;re going to be able to see the whole bunch of people who are not going to be so much like that .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .

Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-26.055561): how can we take the tools of the living systems and try to make their lives ?
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?

Ground Truth: I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a ni@@ cer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
Predicted (-45.740120): I &apos;m in the middle of the room , and I &apos;ve got to see something that I love to do with it , and it &apos;s a little bit like this .

Predicted (-28.833397): she was a girl , and she was like to be a mother , and she was all over .
Ground Truth: and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
Predicted (-43.228188): I &apos;ve been thinking about a long time , and I &apos;ve been talking about the joy of life , and that &apos;s why I have a tremendous impact in the world .

Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-49.786537): I didn &apos;t know what I was going to do with the camera , and it was that the next one was going to be able to go out and get out of the floor .

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Predicted (-10.471018): &quot; I have to go . &quot;
Ground Truth: so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
Predicted (-52.992290): this is a place where they had been taught to be the most vulnerable and to the people who were in the inner time and to make peace .
Src: es geht darum zu wissen , dass man nicht allein ist .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
Predicted (-8.227941): it &apos;s about to say that you don &apos;t know .
Src: es geht darum , unsere Nachbarn zu verstehen und zwar auf eine neue und auf@@ schluss@@ reiche Art und Weise .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enli@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
Predicted (-26.113571): it &apos;s about understanding and giving us the real world and to see it .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
Predicted (-38.290894): it &apos;s about bringing up to the level of happiness and the importance of what we do , and that is to be able to do with us .
Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-163.754364): and I &apos;ve taken this amazing team , and I had a whole bunch of people who were going to go to the National Park , and they had to go back to the world , and I found that these books were used to be used to go into the local , and then , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the United States , , the way , the world was going to be a lot of the way , to have been doing it .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-44.936371): we have found that the way that we can open up our public spaces , and that &apos;s what we need to give up to the more choices .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-25.432117): one of the things that we &apos;ve been doing is to be the things that we have to connect to people .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-41.175972): there &apos;s a lot of time in the world that &apos;s more likely to be able to look at the deep level of happiness and to see what &apos;s happening .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-58.586700): we &apos;re going to talk about death , and it &apos;s not about the fact that we have to remember , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been talking about in the past , but it &apos;s a sense of death .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-17.026421): the idea of death is that we all have to die .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-71.574738): the most important thing is that we &apos;re looking at our communities and our communities are giving up to people who are trying to help us and to make more choices , and that &apos;s what we can do for them .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.139550): thank you .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.139550): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-46.146221): so I &apos;m a very good deal with the math , and it &apos;s a very important example of the fact that we have with a public health system .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-2.713730): nobody knows what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-13.714426): so I &apos;m going to try to tell you what the pilot &apos;s doing .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-10.588938): a dance is one of the most important activities .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-51.552982): we &apos;re doing this with the very open @-@ up , and you can see the pu@@ b , like the top of the house .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-56.997711): and working on a very broad range of partners , and there are a very important component that could be a single component of the genetic material .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-69.557480): and sadly , it &apos;s a very important thing to do with the pleasure of the living , because it &apos;s a very good way to see the I@@ vory .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-20.570765): and in fact , we &apos;ve been doing a lot of the results in high @-@ cost .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-125.560989): yet , there are three different people who have been living in the past , and we have to talk about the disease that we have to have to be able to reduce the death rate of disease , and that &apos;s why we need to do something that &apos;s not about to be able to take care of the long @-@ term , and to have more likely to be more important .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-63.215160): we need to be able to focus the ability and the only thing we can do is to find that there &apos;s a sense of what we need to be able to see if it &apos;s a single @-@ story .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-79.045410): and also , for example , it &apos;s a lot of activity , and it &apos;s also a good thing that you can see in the di@@ gesti@@ ve of the patients , and it &apos;s not a single @-@ dollar @-@ for @-@ minute video .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-31.453018): it &apos;s going to be done in the hospital , and it &apos;s not a very expensive one , but it &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-14.732577): but what if you could take the patient back to this hospital ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-31.323215): this is a hospital @-@ making , and what would happen to the U.S. do if they could do .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-14.325408): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making device .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-22.173977): it &apos;s about 100 dollars to make a prescription for the United States .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-72.868553): so I want to make a sense of what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re going to be able to do with all the way that we call &quot; The F@@ .@@ V. &quot; -- which is very , very , very , very short @-@ term .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-14.568014): here &apos;s a video that shows the musical limb .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-94.859741): it &apos;s a natural way that we can see when we &apos;re doing it , because we have a lot of neurons , and we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of the same thing , because we &apos;re all going to have a call of the F@@ M .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-12.226835): and as a result , we have a lot of training .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-20.326090): think about how long it &apos;s a child , but it &apos;s about to learn .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-48.455906): so , if you &apos;re going to cross the face of the neck , you can see the sound like the <blank> tically @-@ based device .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-17.206709): on the left , you can see a range of te@@ ddy bear .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.661680): we see all the same ones .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-18.977825): voice : un@@ biased , un@@ biased .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-43.489250): and the person is actually more likely to play with a speech and the one is actually a more accurate piece of speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-133.851334): and this ability to be able to play with all these four @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s been shown to be a kind of ubiquitous , but it &apos;s a good example of the fact that we can see in the United States , and it &apos;s been used to be a lot of information that &apos;s been used to be used in the digital ,
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-31.319344): so , if you can do this , you can &apos;t test them , but you &apos;re at the clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-13.004395): and just the way . there &apos;s no infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-10.802071): you have to build a new pocket .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-27.524796): and both are the same . they &apos;re not the ones who are paid for the software .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-10.316379): so you can see , they &apos;re all done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-6.757766): they &apos;re very , very quickly .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-9.388971): we &apos;re very cheap and we know what &apos;s called .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-23.081787): and if you &apos;re a lot of cheap , it &apos;s actually going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-14.223848): and these are the goals that we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-17.213898): we can &apos;t afford to reduce the risk of good patients .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-25.500011): you can &apos;t have a license to go and get the phone .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-18.418938): we can use data to predict the entire range of ways .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-33.124023): we can use these very large @-@ scale studies to be able to do the same @-@ scale research .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-25.685860): so we have to take the first time to find the evidence for cancer , which is more likely to be .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-18.304972): now , we &apos;re going to take the first step in the right @-@ hand interface .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-74.221428): and we have a cross @-@ section of A@@ b@@ .@@ V. , where we have to take the number of people on the planet , and we have to be able to use that to make a full @-@ time basis .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-36.484364): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and we &apos;re going to get out of the planet for about three percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-69.836281): or , if you can use a video , we can use a little bit of a four @-@ year @-@ old , which is a number of sensors that we &apos;ve been able to do for us to keep up with it .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.139550): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-32.485302): if we take a thousand people , you can tell them what they &apos;re going to be , and we can &apos;t be able to feed them .
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-12.769738): what do you take all these kinds of apples ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-42.298176): what happens is that the patient &apos;s ability to control it , and it &apos;s not like a student , but it &apos;s a person .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-18.802862): you may be able to say that , or not at the end .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-56.996738): but there &apos;s a series of different kinds of events that we &apos;re interested in , because it &apos;s the fact that we &apos;re interested in , where they &apos;re related to the number of things that are related to the normal .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-15.739106): now , what is the average cost of 2@@ 60 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.002015): it &apos;s a lot better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-63.913910): my dad taught me that there &apos;s a great work , because it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s so important that it &apos;s going to be able to use the Internet , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done in the process .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-6.448447): I can do that .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-68.525620): and the person can do this , you can see the phone , and you can get the phone , and then you can get a message to the doctor , and you can actually get the data out of the patient .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-19.356401): I live here in the mountains . there &apos;s a national East in Kenya .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-38.612743): and the flowers here , the father of the mine is on the left @-@ up @-@ the @-@ shelf .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-51.301544): the central area is a green @-@ up zone that &apos;s where the Arctic is so much like the Al@@ lah .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-23.058416): the queen , they &apos;re going to see the males and they are doing .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-1.939034): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-36.876148): this is one of the kids who died in the wild , and I was dead . it was just a dead man .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-53.278671): the tribe of Islam , the elephant , and the flowers are coming up with our bodies , and we &apos;re very much going to see the same thing .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-7.241514): as a child , I learned to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-40.413628): the B@@ har@@ i @-@ B@@ al and our daughters are going to protect them from the forest .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.989811): and kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-18.458012): here &apos;s a number of lions that were killed in the woods .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-33.673447): and I think it &apos;s a very , very difficult -- there are just a single @-@ shirt .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-26.828320): he &apos;s a living in the middle of the U.K. , and he was able to feed me for six months .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.113289): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-13.699687): my first idea was to fire , because people were terrified .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-29.258518): but finally , it really seemed to help us , because the doctors don &apos;t want to be able to save the street .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-7.169241): but I didn &apos;t have a set .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-12.744365): I had a second idea . I had a normal one .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-16.177471): I wanted to know that the queen would be attacked .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-7.779136): but spiders are very sensitive .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-46.922928): you see , you see the two @-@ day , and you see it , and you &apos;re going to see the guy , but it &apos;s not going to go back .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-12.753083): and they take the lion and kill us .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-47.162407): I took a little night , and I was walking around the street , and I was just going to take a drop of the grass .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-15.908747): fear is the light that keeps us .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.142421): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-66.173126): and I had a little kid in the back of the day , because I started working on the radio , and I started to see a lot of my kids , and I was going to use it all over the year .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-53.313519): I took a high @-@ tech robot , and you can see a car , and you &apos;re going to get a straight line , and you can see the right @-@ hand side .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-10.024219): and I sent a signal to the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-10.121599): this is a little black @-@ foot lamp .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-5.878954): and then I built all the steps .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-31.157516): the battery is the solar panels that you need to take the battery and the 3D printer .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-11.123653): and the cli@@ mat@@ er .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .

Predicted (-61.494530): it &apos;s a moment for us to be in the past two decades , and we have to be able to measure the quality of life , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be able to go back and save the day .
Ground Truth: because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mile@@ stones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
Predicted (-61.517830): but what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s going to change our eyes , and it &apos;s going to be able to see the same time , because they &apos;re learning how to make it more than half hours ./root/anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/_reduction.py:46: UserWarning: size_average and reduce args will be deprecated, please use reduction='sum' instead.
