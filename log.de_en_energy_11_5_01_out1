Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-75.351547): what I &apos;ve learned about is that in Afghanistan , the end of the day is that , as a result , is that the leader is a very , very honest , and they &apos;re not going to have an interest in their own interest .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-20.698959): that means that our leader can &apos;t be paid in a good way .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-82.671631): they &apos;re often following the fact that they &apos;re in the case of a few , and in fact , the women are in the future , and they &apos;re not going to be able to give a profit in the community .

Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-59.592976): because when I &apos;m in school , I &apos;m in school , I can teach them how to go and go to the community , and then they can help me see the challenges of the war .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-37.796486): Afghanistan is a place where the peace of the community and the day , and I hope to take the rest of them .

Ground Truth: Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .

Ground Truth: but as these conversations un@@ folded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
Predicted (-68.744354): and when the talks started to be , they were actually looking at the under@@ side of the city , and it was really a very simple way to get back to the door .
Ground Truth: that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
Predicted (-54.324944): I was always looking at my work , and I was talking about the people who had this conversation , and I had to think about the fact that the media was really un@@ protected .
Ground Truth: and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
Predicted (-12.116865): I think that open door to open our equipment .
Ground Truth: we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Predicted (-15.725890): we have a tremendous passion for scientists to understand the world .
Ground Truth: our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
Predicted (-70.128510): and our most powerful technologies are in our health , and we don &apos;t know how to deal with the power of technology , and when we talk about it , we &apos;re in fact , there &apos;s no problem , and it &apos;s a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
Predicted (-32.877686): but the amazing thing is that our colleagues are not going to happen to us , because of the engineers are in the world .
Ground Truth: so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
Predicted (-11.764808): and scientists , engineers , designers , are doing it .
Ground Truth: I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
Predicted (-37.592899): let me show you a little bit of this , and I can tell you that the technology is going to be able to do it , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: first question to answer for us : so what ?
Predicted (-16.339027): the first question that we have to do is , and they &apos;re like , right ?
Ground Truth: tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Predicted (-17.525539): now , you know , this is a fundamental basis for what &apos;s happening today .
Ground Truth: don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ osis .
Predicted (-76.725769): they don &apos;t tell us that they &apos;re just going to be an in@@ cur@@ able , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing , because they &apos;re looking at the fact that they &apos;re going to be able to do these kinds of de@@ code .
Ground Truth: and when you &apos;re describing your science , be@@ ware of jargon .
Predicted (-18.881439): and what you do is that you make it a mis@@ conception .
Ground Truth: jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Predicted (-14.484621): there &apos;s a key statement in the mind .
Ground Truth: sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
Predicted (-39.234398): now , &quot; You know , &quot; Why don &apos;t you have time to go and ask yourself , &quot; Well , why does it work for us ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dum@@ bing it down .
Predicted (-22.852081): you don &apos;t understand what the quality of your mind is to be able to do .
Ground Truth: instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
Predicted (-20.809906): Einstein said that the way that &apos;s done , but it &apos;s not possible .
Ground Truth: you can clearly communicate your science without com@@ promising the ideas .
Predicted (-31.822399): you can tell us that a lot of aid in the world is not necessarily a certain amount of legislation .
Ground Truth: a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and ex@@ cite us about your content .
Predicted (-32.227791): some of these things are important to tell us about things , and then we can bring them up to the present .
Ground Truth: and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Predicted (-18.768417): and if you have your work , you can get the credit .
Ground Truth: have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
Predicted (-11.862570): now you have to ask yourself , &quot; Why is it ? &quot;
Src: was geschieht , wenn jemand zu@@ sticht ? ein anderer wird er@@ sto@@ chen , und mit diesen Punkten er@@ ste@@ cht ihr euer Publikum .
Ground Truth: what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
Predicted (-40.128868): what happens is that if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a conversation , and then you &apos;re going to get your hand .
Ground Truth: a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Predicted (-35.769421): so , this is not a little bit like this , but it &apos;s actually a very close @-@ to @-@ up gap .
Ground Truth: instead , this example slide by Gene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Ei@@ ffel Tower .
Predicted (-84.210686): so , the Di@@ on@@ on@@ on@@ ian aspect is that it &apos;s very important to have the fact that the museum is a very common source of the structure that we &apos;ve been able to do with the acoustic system .
Ground Truth: and the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
Predicted (-109.613770): one is the only one that &apos;s the only way that I can use is to use the computer , and it &apos;s a little bit more about the fact that the viewer can use it to do with the fact that it &apos;s going to be able to do with the most amazing and to keep it up .
Ground Truth: so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
Predicted (-33.867744): so there &apos;s some of these guys who are trying to open up the door , and that &apos;s what the science is going to go to the community .
Ground Truth: and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
Predicted (-45.899372): the engineers have taught me that I have a 3D printer , and I have to do something that is to make up a single @-@ minute connection .
Ground Truth: take your science , subtra@@ ct your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
Predicted (-98.646347): if you look at the lens of your talk , and the key to the story is that you &apos;re all talking about , and you can tell me that the content is the most important thing , the creativity , the more you have , the skills that are in the world .
Ground Truth: and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
Predicted (-24.819759): so scientists , engineers , when they do this , they &apos;re all right .

Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-8.259291): you can see three of these things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-55.070290): well , the first thing I can do is -- I don &apos;t know if I have to go to the first person , it &apos;s going to be able to do the latest thing .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-42.189816): Obama , President Obama has a report that he &apos;s not suggesting that there &apos;s a competition for the genocide .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-42.255112): if you can find a good thing , then you can get a letter to the end of that , and then it &apos;s going to be done again .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-50.027092): and the third thing is , is that the only thing that we know about is that the West Bank , or the rest of the world is , &quot; How do you stop the war ? &quot;
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-68.858376): this is what happens to be a few more than the most advanced fish and the largest tuna that is going to have a live @-@ up @-@ and @-@ one @-@ day @-@ old .

Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-64.344749): and the rest of the house was so clear that the president is not going to be married , because the majority of you have said , &quot; You know , the one is going to be a child .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-16.326496): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do , and I &apos;ll give you the one .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-51.318542): the ideas are to try to understand the reality of the language , and also to change the reality of the same time , not only as a positive experience .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.083507): thank you very much .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-70.379272): so I went to a farm with a very small girl named Joseph F@@ our@@ i , who was in the last 50 years of a suicide bomber , with a weapon of cholera .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-60.953323): I was wearing a three @-@ pound s@@ uns@@ ol@@ ar and a half @-@ hour fire@@ flies , and I could actually have a pressure on the ground .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-3.054852): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-145.096756): and after that , I was working with a long time for a long time , a third @-@ time time @-@ old girl who was sitting in the Middle East and Afghanistan , and we had to take the &quot; A@@ gri@@ i @-@ American and @-@ old , &quot; with the most amazing , &quot; to go to the local and to the world .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-6.860148): but that &apos;s the self @-@ preservation .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-72.104271): so here I &apos;m not a Muslim , the West of the United States , the Yu@@ gosla@@ via , the founder of the 19th century , and a community that was working with a crime .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-132.719284): now , there &apos;s no great love in this world , and I can tell you that there &apos;s no way to do it , and that &apos;s what we can do with the art of the world , and that &apos;s what we can do with the magic and the most amazing , to try to make a sense of re@@ frame of re@@ cu@@ tive and re@@ cu@@ cur@@ ate .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-89.724518): I have a day to live in a new country called &quot; The Mon@@ al , &quot; which is a good man , &quot; and the mis@@ sil@@ ences of the mis@@ use of mis@@ sil@@ ences , and they &apos;re talking about corruption .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-42.429802): and what the translator can do is do to make a foreign campaign , and I &apos;ll say , &quot; Here &apos;s a business party . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-38.858204): and to try to do this , to create the company that &apos;s not using the bur@@ gl@@ ings of the Taliban .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-132.824051): I &apos;m going to talk about the problem of the city , and the government is not going to give you a little bit of a car in the streets of Lagos , and they &apos;re going to give them a sign of the money that &apos;s going to be used to be in the streets of Lagos , and they &apos;re going to be able to take out of the food .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-26.991053): I think that in my opinion , the conflict of Afghanistan is going to be a post @-@ conflict .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-167.187332): the rab@@ bi , and the one that has been used to do with a new kind of self @-@ assembly , and it &apos;s made for us to create a re@@ cess for a living , and then you can find a way of re@@ cess for the Al@@ ps of the city , and then you can put it in a few years of re@@ cu@@ cur@@ ate the un@@ ks of the un@@ can@@ ni@@ te .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-166.489883): and I &apos;ll like to see that there &apos;s a little bit of a &quot; The New Yorker &quot; actually , &quot; We &apos;re going to take a look at the fact that the co@@ ar@@ ching of the world is going to be able to take a piece of de@@ code for the genocide of the genocide and the E@@ agle , and then the only one that &apos;s going to be more about to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-26.755501): but for all of these things , you can go into the prison , you can get mis@@ sil@@ ks .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-15.622267): but I do it because I have to use it to protect the self .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-5.902092): that &apos;s my input .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.460802): thank you .
Src: Hi . mein Name ist Cameron Russell und seit einiger Zeit arbeite ich als Model .
Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-20.943153): Hi . my name is a cotton and a nonprofit .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-3.784225): 10 years ago ,
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-51.198742): I mean , this is a sense of being in a room that I &apos;ve been able to put up a box that &apos;s not going to be in .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-12.570401): fortunately , I have a little bit of what I do .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-27.504169): this is the first time that you get to the TED Talk , and I think you &apos;re going to be happy .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-45.739143): and I have a lot of people , because I &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re going to do it , and I &apos;ll tell you that the first time .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-33.295963): I &apos;m actually sure that in a very difficult moment , because I think it &apos;s going to be able to make something more quickly .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-7.521105): no one has to do that .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-29.715757): the number of things are very , very uncomfortable , because I don &apos;t know they &apos;re supposed to be .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-46.658607): the key part is that I &apos;m going to do something like this , because I &apos;m going to tell you about your ears , and then you &apos;re going to do something .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-0.432172): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-1.986713): why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-2.682389): it was embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-14.784112): now , I was not sure that this was like a moment .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-11.478745): a symbol is something that &apos;s remarkable .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-15.850460): I &apos;ve been able to focus all over the last 30 seconds .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-16.355886): and this is the moment I had a real girl .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-32.307556): I was very proud of my dad , and I was trying to put up the helmet and put it in my face .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-107.720520): and at the end of the day , there &apos;s no one @-@ time time , and it &apos;s not just a little bit of the time that we put in our hands , and it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do , to find out that we can actually have a whole life @-@ to @-@ making .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-10.508758): it &apos;s easier to be true for me .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-9.112653): and I stand up here in this stage .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-28.977530): I &apos;m on the right side of this , because I &apos;m a young girl , and I &apos;m a guy in the kitchen .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-28.220287): I &apos;m going to ask the question that people are now , and I think , the more people .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.598210): the first question is , how do you do ?
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.085470): I said , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve always been saying that .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-40.553219): the reason I think that the public is a kind of a brand @-@ like version of this , and it &apos;s a very important example .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-98.132233): now , most of us have been in the deep universe , and we &apos;re not very good at finding a very , very , very , very strange and so @-@ called , and it &apos;s a very important thing to be called the F@@ ish .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-12.245119): this is a legacy , and it &apos;s made for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-69.385048): there &apos;s a very good audience . I think that &apos;s the one that &apos;s known to be , like , &quot; R@@ ace , &quot; and &quot; A@@ w@@ .@@ D@@ P . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-15.285619): and then I want to show you a very , very impressive .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-107.454559): but I &apos;ve shown you that in the first four @-@ year @-@ old , in the &apos; 60s , the student , the only one that has been able to do that , and the only one that &apos;s the most surprising thing is that the quality of the video is not going to be done .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-28.861240): the next question is , &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you , if I &apos;m going to be a game called , &quot; Yeah ?
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.028280): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know that there &apos;s no responsibility . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-17.808430): but the second one I want to do is , &quot; Why are we going to have some girls ?
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-3.855209): you know what ? you can .
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-67.968124): you can have the U.S. or the American citizen , and the person in the morning is a complete mis@@ conception of &quot; C@@ enti@@ ful , &quot; and I &apos;m going to have a bad idea .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-40.730087): and when you &apos;re talking about the whole , they &apos;re not going to say , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s a crazy thing . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-68.967781): I don &apos;t have a passion for the company , but it &apos;s not the most important thing to do with the American and the M@@ .D. / A @-@ A @-@ E @-@ E @-@ state .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-39.410114): so , you know , if you want to do something like that , you &apos;ll have to say that the lottery is going to be a bit more .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-15.003107): it can &apos;t be understood and it &apos;s not going to be awesome .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-29.735947): now , I want to show you a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , because it &apos;s a very different concept of control .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-136.496201): there &apos;s a little man who &apos;s in the middle of the watch , and then you can see that there &apos;s a little bit of a baby , and then the only one that &apos;s going to be able to go back and see , and then the next one is , and then we &apos;re going to take a piece of paper , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get out of the old .
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-5.456230): it &apos;s about that .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-8.571501): sometimes this is a little bit more like that .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-11.069976): I was like , &quot; Well , that &apos;s what happened .
Predicted (-94.364632): the school has a little bit more , and I &apos;ll tell you that it &apos;s not going to go to school , and you &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , if you &apos;re in the middle of the school , you &apos;ll have a lot of money , you can see that the most expensive in the U.S.
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-15.205691): so the question that I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-30.722694): now , these guys are pretty much , but it &apos;s just a little bit of a re@@ cess .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-52.962719): this is the first one that I did . I was actually a photograph that I had , and I was at the end of the day , and he was actually a little bit like this .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
Predicted (-13.037645): I know that &apos;s true , but I &apos;m a very lucky person .
Ground Truth: this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
Predicted (-16.990946): so I just saw a few weeks ago , which was a lot of my grandmother .

Ground Truth: and I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
Predicted (-10.141609): and I hope you &apos;ll see these pictures , not all of us .
Ground Truth: they are constru@@ ctions , and they are constru@@ ctions by a group of professionals , by hair@@ sty@@ lists and makeup artists and photographers and sty@@ lists and all of their assist@@ ants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
Predicted (-61.673592): there are groups of artists , and they are the kind of par@@ ting and open @-@ source tools , and they &apos;re all the best of the people who are in the museum , and they &apos;re not listening .
Ground Truth: okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
Predicted (-18.637712): now , the next thing you ask , &quot; How do you get all the stuff ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
Predicted (-51.641518): yes , I have a few of them in the no@@ zz@@ ling , but I don &apos;t have the most expensive things that I can do , and I don &apos;t know how to do it .
Ground Truth: I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
Predicted (-36.865555): I went to a school in Chicago , and I got a good day , and I got to buy a shower and I had all the money .
Ground Truth: when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sor@@ ry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
Predicted (-71.555069): when I was a friend of mine , I was a very bad car , and I got a press , and I got a very excited , and we &apos;d never go back to the hospital .
Ground Truth: and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
Predicted (-54.458801): I have no idea of how many men are , because they &apos;re not paying attention to the people , and they &apos;re not going to be a good part of the day .
Ground Truth: I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fris@@ ked , 86 percent of them were black and Lat@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
Predicted (-55.543396): I live in New York , and the majority of the U.S. and the people who are still in high @-@ tech and tired , and they are more likely to be killed .
Ground Truth: and there are only 17@@ 7,000 young black and Lat@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-39.605270): it &apos;s about 12 @-@ year @-@ old New York , and the homeless woman who &apos;s not going to be looking for the truth .
Src: sondern : &quot; wie oft werde ich angehalten ? wann werde ich angehalten ? &quot;
Ground Truth: but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
Predicted (-6.062899): but how often do I go ? &quot;
Ground Truth: when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
Predicted (-87.189850): and I learned that my research on this line is that when the women were at the end of the year , they were able to do that , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re not going to be able to get down to the top of the United States .
Src: die letzte Frage an mich lautet : &quot; wie ist es , ein Model zu sein ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
Predicted (-9.594794): the final question is , &quot; How is it a system ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ nier and you have sh@@ in@@ ier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
Predicted (-37.701973): and I think you &apos;ll think that if you &apos;re a little more likely , you &apos;ll have a big hair , and you &apos;ll hear it .
Src: und back@@ stage geben wir eine Antwort , die vielleicht diesen Eindruck vermittelt .

Ground Truth: if there &apos;s a tak@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowle@@ dging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .

Predicted (-15.609299): and when he was older , he was so different and more .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .

Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-28.954193): beauty is the same , and we can tell ourselves that there is no matter of what we &apos;re doing .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .

Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-6.682880): you can be quite extraordinary .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-85.000343): but whether there are no , there &apos;s no one , and we are all the best , there &apos;s a gift that we have to be in the world -- that &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very positive .

Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-59.720299): so we can take the camera to see the space of our eyes and try to figure out how to put out the window , and we can only see the robot in front of us .

Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-117.183739): and I &apos;ll give you an example of a single electron in the back of the stream , and that &apos;s a little bit more than a thousand , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re going to be able to do a little bit of a multi @-@ dimensional space , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the next two @-@ hour , and that &apos;s the speed of light .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?

Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-87.648209): so , of course , this is a rocket that &apos;s going to take a little bit of time , and it &apos;s about the speed of the light that you can see , but it &apos;s a little bit like this , and then you can put the screen over the next 10 seconds .

Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-24.500828): and it &apos;s a part of the water that &apos;s coming up to the table .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-30.081381): the most surprising thing is that the neuron has come up with a radically different footprint .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-14.435037): you can see , there &apos;s a balloon that goes through the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-64.772377): the walls are coming up , and the point is that the flow of the ceiling is all in the way that you can see , and they &apos;re in the front of the boxes .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-68.391342): so if you have a quick video , and we &apos;re going to take the same thing , and you can see the average one of the 10 @-@ year @-@ old , and then we &apos;re going to go to the screen .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-6.028512): a week , a day , no ?
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-17.335976): this is a very boring -- a little bit of a human being .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-15.792494): and what about this is a life @-@ lapse experience ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-35.954208): you can see the walls , and the R@@ ace of the background , the walls and the floor .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-11.014956): it &apos;s like a rock in a shoe .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-55.062370): and I thought that it was like this , because it &apos;s just a picture of a human being , and it &apos;s actually not just a li@@ sting image .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-62.531860): but if you look at this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s some more light that will be left in the wild , and you &apos;ll see that the secret is going to be able to keep the water .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-64.270065): why is this ? because the electron is the one that &apos;s going to take a little bit of a stick and then it &apos;s about to get out of the ground .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-75.961456): so , in the lab , if you can take a camera in the office , you can see that it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s safe , and you can actually get into a light @-@ up , and it &apos;s not a li@@ der .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-11.182912): so , my team at MIT has built ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-80.020058): now , as you see , you know , a few minutes , you can see that the camera is a little bit more difficult than you have to do , and you can see that the Earth is a little bit more difficult for a time .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-100.811768): so we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;re going to take this piece of tape , and we &apos;ll see the same thing that &apos;s going to be able to do this , and we &apos;re going to use this video , and we &apos;ll see that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more powerful .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.425247): and we can use all these data , and actually , to make things very much .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-8.500050): so , Sylvia is able to fly .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-48.070747): voice : can these beautiful , beautiful @-@ scale things like this , but can we find a new way of being a 21st @-@ century ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-7.850883): the idea is that we have to light up .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-48.454979): it &apos;s going to be thrown out in the middle of the room , and it &apos;s going to be able to take the door and see the full of the camera .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-10.710244): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve actually got it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-9.704766): and you see the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-22.574005): and on the wall , it &apos;s a wall where we &apos;re going to open the door .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-56.372257): when the book was written in our work , it &apos;s been made by a bunch of research that &apos;s been shown in the open @-@ source code .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-159.538483): we can send these red light @-@ up , and the signal is that every single one of these light @-@ up , and then the signal is going to be taken into the ears , and then you can see that every single one of these things will be made , and the most powerful light that &apos;s going to be made in the middle of the box , and then they &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit more .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-19.939522): and so we have a camera that &apos;s all around us is actually a camera .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-20.628181): it &apos;s a very good thing , and it &apos;s going to be able to see the world in the air .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-47.846710): so , we know that the presence of the body , but it &apos;s not the point of view , because we have to remember the point of the road .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-125.964806): if we &apos;re going to show a laser , which is a little bit like this , and we can see that the camera is going to be able to see the sound of the screen , and then we can see that it &apos;s going to be able to do something that &apos;s going to be made up , and we &apos;re going to have a little bit of a little bit of the amount of paper .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-4.079450): can we go into 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-6.502744): so here &apos;s the I@@ RA .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-136.701309): we have to do something that we &apos;ve got to do with the first step in the lab , and we can see that if we can take out of the outside , and then we can see the right thing , and we can see the right @-@ hand , in the back @-@ to @-@ the @-@ hand , and we can go back to the back of the process , and go out to the lab .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-79.381142): and because of course , the de@@ code is so powerful that we can actually take a long time to take a tool , and it &apos;s actually a very , very exciting tool for the next generation of scientists in the field of science .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-111.367867): so , as an artist , in fact , in fact , is that we &apos;ve been able to show a film that &apos;s been using a great science fiction , and it &apos;s not only four times , but we can use all of these images , and we can see that in the history of the world , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-6.108125): but there &apos;s something really happened .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .

Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-5.577893): the waves should be moving .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-2.470252): what &apos;s happening ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-51.802067): it &apos;s actually because we thought that we could have a lot of light , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in the early words of this very beautiful .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-63.422161): in the past , in the context of the experiment , it &apos;s been shown in the position of the space , and it &apos;s not just the point that we can use in the memory .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-151.181717): instead of giving us a new , like , to be able to take the knowledge of the creation of our own lives and the most important tools of the world , to take out of the code and to go back and say , &quot; We &apos;re going to be able to take the data and use of the tools of the knowledge of the creation of the creation of the scientific and the scientific process . &quot;
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .

Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-6.882878): there are many ways of changing our own lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-60.668961): we don &apos;t have a woman who are on the street , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do all the way to make sure that they &apos;re all on the road .

Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-101.887810): yet , there are three people who are still living in the world , and the amount of food that we have to do is to have the same disease that we have to do with the death of the disease , and the more people who have to do it , to try to save them .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-62.771946): we can start to create the open @-@ source , and that &apos;s the only way we can do it , because we have to find that there &apos;s no longer a moment to think about the fact that we can do .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-66.673378): so , in fact , there &apos;s no good activity , and it &apos;s also a good thing for the patients , and you can see that there &apos;s no more sophisticated action in the video .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-32.370247): it &apos;s done to be a hospital , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s not a very expensive one .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-12.923662): but what if patients were going to take this surgery ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-27.549107): this is a hospital that could take away from the hospital , and what would you do ?
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-11.901248): it &apos;s not a hospital @-@ making .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-19.006691): it &apos;s about 250 dollars to make a look at the U.N. .
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-49.609058): so I want to do something that we &apos;re trying to do in a very short way , because we can do this , which is the most un@@ consciously possible way .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-15.154880): here &apos;s a video where you see the sound of a magnetic pulse .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-101.269638): the animal is a sense of self @-@ assembly , because we can see that if we &apos;re all going to have a good message , we can get rid of them , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of these neurons , and we &apos;re going to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-15.304425): and as we do , it &apos;s a very successful exercise .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-16.479221): think about it , for a long time , you know , it &apos;s a kid .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-59.675064): so , by the way , we can move the li@@ li@@ b , and you can see the li@@ f@@ board , so that &apos;s the sound of the spinal cord .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-34.367390): on the left , you can see a rubber band that &apos;s going to be used on a permanent basis .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-2.773424): we see all the same .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-13.644312): voice , C , etc .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-29.402765): the language is actually more and more of the time , and it &apos;s a reward for the speech .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-121.819237): so the ability to do this , and the ability to do this is to be a multi @-@ dimensional , and it &apos;s a lot of attention to the brain , and it &apos;s also a high @-@ tech , but it &apos;s used to be able to read by the fact that we can do with a lot of time .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-39.696690): so , if you can do this , you can see , in fact , are the clinical trials , they &apos;re not at least clinical trials .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-6.630653): just like the infrastructure .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-9.362842): you have no need to build new jobs .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-5.738030): and they are both right .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-7.442115): so they can be done .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-5.369537): they &apos;re very , very quickly .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-7.853012): we &apos;re very cheap , and we know what this is called .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-17.977579): and if you &apos;re extremely cheap , it &apos;s actually a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-9.675551): so the goals are able to do this .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-10.705554): we can help the low @-@ cost .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-18.569689): patients have no need to put a battery in the clinic .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-15.105020): we can use the data to restore .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-47.795174): we can use the same @-@ effective treatment for the first time , and we can actually take a number of studies to get out of the world .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-20.993443): now we have the first time to explore the microbial community , which is to kill for the disease .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-27.187588): now , we &apos;re going to do this right now , and we &apos;re going to start the key to the user .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-61.440060): and I have a par@@ ab@@ i@@ ting , with a free @-@ to @-@ day , where we have access to the data that we have to do with the first time .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-26.504742): we have a blank sh@@ ack , and the half of the world is about 100 percent .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-69.548256): or a keyboard , with a hand@@ bag , you can do it , with four @-@ minute , we can have a four @-@ year @-@ old , which is a lot of time to do it .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.038436): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-31.696154): if we take some of them , you can tell people who are going to be healthy , and then you can &apos;t tell them .
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-10.422771): what are you going to do with these all of them ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-36.372627): what happens is that the patient has to be in front of the patient &apos;s attention , but it &apos;s not a matter of seconds .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-13.133623): maybe there are some things that will be done .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-46.001701): but there &apos;s a whole variety of different sources of information that we &apos;re interested in , because it &apos;s very important to show that these are the ones that are affected by the external areas .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-16.339054): now , the average of them is 0.@@ 7 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-1.984630): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-60.297760): my father , I &apos;m working on his work , because there &apos;s a great thing that we can do -- it &apos;s so amazing that it &apos;s going to be used to do with the Internet .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-4.102711): this is what I call .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-61.531277): the person can say that you can take the phone , and then you can get the phone , and the person can get the attention to the program , and then you can get a job .
Src: genau .
Ground Truth: absolutely .
Predicted (-0.900489): right .

Ground Truth: thanks , Tom .
Predicted (-0.621848): thank you .
Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-5.889395): I live here in Kenya .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-34.288994): and here &apos;s the father of the mine in the Bronx , and this is the lead @-@ to @-@ the @-@ home .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-60.464272): the M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ M@@ T is a very limited place where the ocean is going to be able to do all the way to do .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-10.894337): the queen , the lions and they do .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-1.692942): they kill us .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-40.270164): this is one of my father , and every night , I was in the morning , and she was dead . it was a bad one .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-52.954491): the tribe of the forest , the elephant , and the elephant is so close to our bodies , and we all know that they &apos;re going to be so much about .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-6.288583): as a child , I learned to hate .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-29.802433): our soldiers are called the N@@ an@@ i and the O@@ il .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-2.219816): and kill lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-13.996887): here &apos;s a woman who was running in Portugal .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-35.496941): and I think , in fact , there &apos;s a big threat in the world -- there are no co@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ ars .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-25.921608): he was a member of the United States , and my father was six months old .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-2.608370): I had to find a solution .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-6.817171): the first idea was to fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-36.006504): and then , I realized that it &apos;s not really possible to help us , but the doctors could help the girls .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-4.727871): I didn &apos;t have .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-8.850184): I had a second idea . I had a cow .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-16.036913): I wanted to know that the queen was going to hide .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-7.208275): but females are very smart .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-48.310551): you see the walk , and you see the little guy coming back , and they &apos;re going to go back and see that &apos;s not going to go .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-11.324851): and they take the soil and kill .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-45.943306): one night I was walking down to the wall , and I was walking down to the road , and we just got a camera on the left .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-10.791842): no matter what &apos;s happening .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.352985): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-83.324699): and I was a little kid in the room , and I started working on my little little day , and I started to get a lot of money , and I was going to see that the entire school was going to be used to be .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-42.087536): I took a high @-@ powered car , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and you can see the right @-@ hand side .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-17.558187): and I decided to give a light bulb , and the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-7.300742): this is a little black box .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
Predicted (-3.547551): and then I built all together .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a trans@@ former .
Predicted (-35.411674): the solar battery is the need to take a 3D printer and it &apos;s called the energy .
Src: und der Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: and the indic@@ ator box makes the lights flash .
Predicted (-9.308011): and the two @-@ dimensional light .
Ground Truth: as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
Predicted (-15.280501): you can see the ra@@ fts that are coming out of the ocean .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Predicted (-7.294808): so that &apos;s what the lions look like .
Ground Truth: the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Predicted (-28.718412): the blind lions are coming out of the night , and I &apos;m going to get out of the night .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thanks .
Predicted (-0.038436): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
Predicted (-29.027473): I &apos;ve been working on the home and we had no access to what we &apos;ve been doing .
Ground Truth: and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
Predicted (-5.409590): and then we left our neighbors .
Ground Truth: one of them was this grandmother .
Predicted (-2.608622): one of them was a grandmother .
Ground Truth: she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
Predicted (-29.395344): she had many of her arms standing in the morning , and she was able to see what they were doing .
Src: und ich sagte : &quot; ja &quot; .
Ground Truth: and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Predicted (-1.384740): and I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
Ground Truth: so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Predicted (-11.361036): I mean , we can put the camera on the left .
Ground Truth: since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
Predicted (-35.462669): I &apos;ve been living in the house with seven volunteers and then they have a better way to get out .
Ground Truth: and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other predators like hy@@ enas , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Predicted (-84.733643): now , this is a very good idea of what the ocean is , not just like the pat@@ ches of the plants , but they &apos;re used to be used to be used to be more like the most vulnerable .
Src: meine Erfindung ver@@ half mir zu einem ein Stipendium an einer der besten Schulen in Kenia , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , und ich bin wirklich aufgeregt .

Ground Truth: my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
Predicted (-21.123526): my new education is to help and get rid of the aid .
Src: ich habe sogar meine Freunde mit nach Hause gebracht und gemeinsam installieren wir die Lichter dort , wo es noch keine gibt , und ich zeige den Menschen , wie man sie benutzt .
Ground Truth: I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
Predicted (-49.038780): I also had a house with my friends and I &apos;m still looking at the store , and we can see it in the world where they &apos;re doing it .
Ground Truth: so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland her@@ ding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
Predicted (-55.932941): one of the months I was walking through a boy called &quot; The Mar@@ der , &quot; and I was going to go back to a little girl , and I was going to see him .

Predicted (-16.915718): I &apos;m going to be a big pilot , and I &apos;m going to be a designer .
Ground Truth: I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Predicted (-60.447002): unfortunately , I &apos;ve been able to do that , and I can &apos;t do it with the power of the day , and I can &apos;t get the message to the river .

Ground Truth: but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
Predicted (-21.209003): yes , I have a nuclear weapon , but I &apos;m very excited about all the way .

Ground Truth: we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Predicted (-30.116768): so , in a year , we started to see this morning , and we started to see the same thing .
Ground Truth: well you can see where this is going .
Predicted (-8.326805): well , you can see where the wheel is going .
Ground Truth: approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sab@@ ina back to New York and make it a father @-@ daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
Predicted (-55.655369): and my mother , when the daughter told me that she was a friend of mine , &quot; Why don &apos;t you take a trip to the South Bronx , and she said , &quot; How do you do this ? &quot;
Src: damals fingen wir an , vorbei@@ laufende Touristen zu bitten , ein Bild von uns zu machen .
Ground Truth: this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
Predicted (-36.184822): so , we started to start to see some of these days , and we would just imagine .
Ground Truth: you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of hand@@ ing your camera to a total stranger .
Predicted (-23.999908): what &apos;s remarkable is that you can see the most common memory of your hand .
Ground Truth: no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Predicted (-27.800194): nobody has always been lucky , and nobody has ever been able to do with the front of us .
Ground Truth: back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
Predicted (-27.415720): but we had actually seen that this day , our life would be really moving .
Src: diese Reise ist uns sehr heilig geworden .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
Predicted (-6.878772): this journey is very important .
Ground Truth: this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five @-@ year @-@ old could understand .
Predicted (-37.242680): this was just about 24 hours ago , and I was going to watch this morning , and that was what I could do for the first time .
Src: diese Bilder sind viel mehr als nur ein fest@@ ge@@ halten@@ er Moment , oder eine bestimmte Reise .
Ground Truth: so these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
Predicted (-19.541983): these are thousands of times more than any one , but it &apos;s a certain way .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Predicted (-65.245514): they are in a moment for our generation , and for example , in the past , in the past , we have no longer been able to change the time , and we &apos;re going to be in the same time ./root/anaconda3/envs/pytorch/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torch/nn/_reduction.py:46: UserWarning: size_average and reduce args will be deprecated, please use reduction='sum' instead.

Ground Truth: because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new mile@@ stones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
Predicted (-73.553833): but the same thing is that we &apos;re seeing our lives , when we &apos;re trying to change the entire world , it &apos;s going to be able to see the same time , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticipate the entire year .
Predicted (-33.591553): so , the most sophisticated work we do is we &apos;re spending a little bit of time and we &apos;re going to stop .
Ground Truth: recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
Predicted (-88.037811): so , in a while , we went back to the camp , and we went to a school where she was looking at her , and she was able to see a lot of the food that they put in a b@@ ou@@ tre@@ ach .
Ground Truth: and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
Predicted (-19.350584): and she told me that her husband was at the end of the age of this little age .
Src: sie sagte , dass sie sich daran erinnert wie ihr das Herz aus der Brust sprang , als sie vor neun Jahren den Laden zum ersten Mal sah .
Ground Truth: she said she remembers her heart bur@@ sting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
Predicted (-49.718414): she said that she was the only way she was looking at the heart of the grandmother , and she was going to take a baby in the middle of the year .
Ground Truth: and now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
Predicted (-27.984291): but they go to New York , and they &apos;re in a very high school in the world .
Src: und mir wurde schlag@@ artig klar : das Wichtigste , was wir alle erschaffen , sind Erinnerungen .
Ground Truth: and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
Predicted (-24.291092): and I realized that what &apos;s really important is , all of us have to be able to do .
Ground Truth: so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
Predicted (-20.782230): and so I want to share with you a unique idea of creating a kind of empathy .
Ground Truth: I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
Predicted (-26.639473): I don &apos;t know what it looks like , but I &apos;m going to show you this photograph of a couple of weeks .
Src: ich bin immer der , der das Bild macht .
Ground Truth: I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
Predicted (-8.261027): I &apos;m always the one that &apos;s doing .
Ground Truth: so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hes@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Predicted (-47.503830): I want to leave you with all of us with a sudden , and I would like to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be a guy who &apos;s going to be in a picture .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.083507): thank you very much .
