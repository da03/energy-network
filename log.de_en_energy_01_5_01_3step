Predicted (-58.624763): but when I go to school , I &apos;m going to be in the school , and I &apos;m going to take a look at the work of my children , and then they &apos;re going to be a part of the future .

Ground Truth: instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under Republican or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chief magi@@ strate , titles of respect@@ ability -- not bloody President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maje@@ sty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ularity , i@@ .@@ e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
Predicted (-148.609100): and after the first time , we can &apos;t be able to do it , not only to be able to do it , but in the &apos; 80s , the president of the West , and the political system , and the only thing that is that the most important thing is not going to be able to do with the political and the political system , not to be able to do it .
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.185722): you can see a little bit of things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-46.602478): and I &apos;m just saying that the best thing I &apos;ve done is -- I &apos;m not going to get the last one to the press .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-42.983700): the president of the Obama administration said that he &apos;s only going to win the answer , because it &apos;s not just a few weeks .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-49.902718): if you think that you can get a new one , then you &apos;ll never be able to get a doctor , and then it &apos;s a very successful case .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-44.388924): and the final thing is that the most important thing is , is that the last thing you have in the United States is not going to be true for America ?
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-54.303413): and the thing that you have is that the world is going to be a little bit more than the largest and the most advanced and the billions of dollars .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-13.901831): and the story is the form of a piece .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-7.808844): and this is the same thing .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-9.038214): you have a big deal .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-25.897882): and the other side of the world is the one that &apos;s been trained , as I know .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-9.808420): but how do you know that a single country ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-5.453887): it was eight .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-39.196438): and you know , if you &apos;re going to get to the guys , they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the mouse .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-60.518768): and the first thing that the president is losing the law , and yet , if you don &apos;t have any money , it &apos;s the case that you &apos;re going to be in the United States .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-22.539450): and that &apos;s the most important thing you can do with me , and I &apos;m going to take you through the project .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-42.146889): now , we can understand how to change the reality of the world , and even though words are more complex than the truth of the world .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.611947): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-73.565765): so I went to a little bit of a year @-@ old , and we went to the United States , and a great deal with a great @-@ time @-@ old , high @-@ death .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-69.510864): I was a little bit of a p@@ ale @-@ box , and I put a little bit of a di@@ re @-@ cut @-@ cut cut on the back of the box .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-4.973060): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-173.428604): and I was a little bit more than a couple of years ago , and we were able to go to the local and the same thing , and we were able to do this with a little bit of a p@@ ier@@ cing , and the way that we could go to the world , and we would be able to do this with a non @-@ governmental and a non @-@ governmental and a @-@ violent and a @-@ sex relationship between the world .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-5.262569): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-62.767418): so I &apos;m here , the two @-@ thirds of the country , the former Soviet Union , and the former Soviet Union , and the one in the United States is a non @-@ governmental organization .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-115.877228): I &apos;m not interested in how many other things can be , but I think it &apos;s a wonderful way to bring the world out of the world , and it &apos;s a little bit of a lot of ways to do it , and to make it feel like this , and to make it a sense of the power of the magic .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-91.159248): I &apos;d like to take a new man of the world , and the great thing about the world is to take a lot of sexual abuse , and we have a great de@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of the mon@@ archy .
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-66.301697): and if the government is going to be a business party , and then we asked the question to do this : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a lawyer , &quot; and I &apos;m going to take a job . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-33.573933): and this is what they call &quot; The Re@@ cords &quot; to be able to do with their own business .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-138.862274): I &apos;m going to talk about the U.S. government , and the reason is to go to the local market is to take a look at the front of the police , and we &apos;re going to take a look at the way that they &apos;re going to be able to take a look at the money , and we &apos;re not going to get a place where they &apos;re going to do with the best of the money .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-28.211559): I think that the question of what I &apos;m going to do is look at the conflict in the country .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-138.885513): and the people who are going to be able to do this with a new kind of open @-@ source , and then we can take a look at the local and re@@ constructing a new kind of a local local , and then we could use the old @-@ fashioned and un@@ contacted by the local community of the world .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-200.094650): and I can tell you how to take a little bit of the &quot; The O@@ th@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ ers of the National Museum of Sciences , &quot; which is a very important part of the world , and it &apos;s going to be able to bring the power of the world to the local and to be able to get rid of their own de@@ par@@ ted from the &quot; The O@@ th@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ f &quot; in .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-27.239483): but in those things , you can get to that point where you &apos;re going to be un@@ interrupted .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-14.078732): but I do believe it &apos;s because they &apos;re in the process .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-10.684031): that &apos;s my point . what is your lifestyle ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.045233): thank you .
Src: Hi . mein Name ist Cameron Russell und seit einiger Zeit arbeite ich als Model .
Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-27.548412): my name is Hi . I &apos;m a lot of my talk , and I &apos;m sure .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-11.690538): so , for 10 years , it &apos;s happened .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-48.818859): and I think this is a little bit of a room that would have been put into my own room , and I don &apos;t have to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-9.618748): I &apos;m a little bit more nervous .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-35.131348): this is the first time that you can see a moment in the world , and I &apos;ll be able to tell you how to do it .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-42.102680): and I &apos;d be a lot more , so I &apos;d like to say , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not going to get this shot .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-36.223022): I think it &apos;s very clear that I can put in a very short period , because I think there &apos;s a new way of seeing .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-9.014062): and no one has to do it .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-18.672787): and the good thing is that they &apos;re not too good at it .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-59.867561): the only thing that &apos;s going to be a little bit more , because if you &apos;re on the right , I &apos;m going to go to your head , you &apos;re not going to get to the other .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.345613): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.391697): so why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-8.319750): that was a very embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-18.888885): so , I don &apos;t think that this was a pretty exciting way .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-15.299499): it &apos;s a powerful , but it &apos;s a very powerful picture .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-16.487431): I &apos;m sure that all of you have been in my pocket .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-15.614354): and this is a moment where I didn &apos;t even know any one .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-45.783943): I was very afraid to go and see my father , and I was looking at the same kind of guy who was sitting in my pocket .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-88.065559): and as the rest of the day , we have a little bit of the way that I think it &apos;s not just about the same thing , and it &apos;s a little bit more important than the rest of the world , and it &apos;s a way that we can do it .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-16.477047): and to be honest , I &apos;m too happy to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-10.468301): and I &apos;m standing in the middle of this one .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-33.884876): I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , and I &apos;m a guy who &apos;s a big girl .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-19.006752): I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be done on the other hand .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-5.868969): the first question is , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-12.746252): I said , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not true .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-61.793518): the second thing is that I think , if you &apos;re a national and an economic model , it &apos;s a very important thing to be a little bit more interested in how we can be .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-77.957176): now , we &apos;ve been working in the same way , and we &apos;re not just a very strong , and we &apos;re very happy to see how the universe is , and it &apos;s a very strong form of survival .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-26.690834): and this is an architect , and it &apos;s worth me , and it &apos;s a plan for it .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-90.088150): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit like a mess , and I think , &quot; Oh , you know , there &apos;s a lot of h@@ ells , &quot; and the wind is going to be a good thing .
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-17.461853): and the first thing you do is I think , very simple .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-209.507477): but I think that the project is a very long time , and it &apos;s been done with a single @-@ scale , and it &apos;s not a single one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old , and that &apos;s where you &apos;ve got to get a little bit of the biggest , and it &apos;s not just a single one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ one @-@ half @-@ to @-@ one @-@ to @-@ half @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ one @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ to @-@ the @-@ the @-@ the @-@ live record .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-33.099396): the next question is , &quot; When will I come to the future be , I think , &quot; Well , is there a problem ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.081908): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s not the right thing . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-18.599064): so the other part of the question is , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of that question . &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.315619): you know what you do ?
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-61.008484): you know , if you &apos;re going to be the best @-@ selling car or the American dream , you can see the next one , and then you &apos;re going to be a big deal .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-52.435608): and if you &apos;re all going to be a little bit more , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , no , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a lawyer . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-65.072868): I don &apos;t want to be the best or the best @-@ selling company or the English @-@ selling book , and the answer is , &quot; The New Yorker is a little bit more pi@@ per . &quot;
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-43.404758): and you &apos;ll say , if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the wrong thing , you &apos;re going to be able to get the word .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-19.455853): you can &apos;t understand it , and it &apos;s not the case . it &apos;s not a great failure .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-40.267288): I &apos;m going to show you the first time in the world , because you can &apos;t see the same thing as a medical record .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-131.492264): and if you look at this guy , you can see the front line , and you can see the front of the robot , and he &apos;s going to go back to the front line , and then you go back to the front , and you can see , and you can see , &quot; The next step , &quot; and the only one is the first thing that he &apos;s going to do .
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-2.683025): it looks like this .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-14.340853): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-5.579199): I didn &apos;t know what this is .
Predicted (-78.965485): and if you get a lot of money , you &apos;ll get a job , and you &apos;ll never see the money , but if you &apos;re going to do this , you &apos;ll see that there &apos;s no money in the &apos; 80s , you can &apos;t get a good word .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-25.369396): the question is , &quot; When will I tell you that the audience is going to be completely different ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
Predicted (-31.794773): but the other ones are just a little bit of a little bit , but it &apos;s just the same thing .
Src: das ist das allererste Foto , das ich gemacht habe , und das war auch das allererste Mal , dass ich einen Bi@@ kin@@ i trug . ich hatte damals noch nicht einmal meine Periode .
Ground Truth: this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
Predicted (-36.003284): this is the first piece that I did , and I was a little bit of the movie , and I &apos;ve never seen it before .
Ground Truth: I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
Predicted (-15.208696): I think it &apos;s a little bit , but I &apos;m a young child .
Ground Truth: this is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .

Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-36.955566): well , I can be sure that I had a chance to be able to read the stories of my life that I &apos;ve seen before .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-63.442204): but I want to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; I &apos;ve got to do anything about the relationship between the skills and the things that are not about .
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-53.170433): so the perception of the difference is that we can &apos;t see the difference between us and the other one is , and it &apos;s a bit more likely to be .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-13.923070): it &apos;s just one way to say that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-40.265766): and I &apos;d like to say that if you &apos;re a friend and I can do something , and then you can &apos;t be able to do it .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-9.973886): you can be a very powerful way .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-64.282349): because , if you &apos;re a little bit of shame , we &apos;re not a single one , and we &apos;re all born -- that &apos;s a gift of the gift of the gift .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-35.941620): the amount of life in the world is going to be done in a way that we can go back and look at it .
Src: bitte - sagen Sie mir nicht , dass ich normal bin .
Ground Truth: please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Predicted (-12.869309): so , I say , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.330904): thank you .
Ground Truth: Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet p@@ ier@@ cing through an apple , and exposure just a million@@ th of a second .
Predicted (-85.102699): and he was doing a remarkable piece of a film that &apos;s made by a little bit of a p@@ ung@@ ed and a gl@@ om@@ an@@ an@@ ed piece of a piece of his skull .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-39.771355): but the next time , we &apos;re going to see a billion years , and a half a million people are not going to be a single step in the world .
Src: ich stelle Ihnen eine neue Art der Fotografie vor , die F@@ em@@ to @-@ Fotografie , eine neue Ab@@ bild@@ ungste@@ chnik , die so schnell ist , dass sie Zeit@@ lu@@ pen@@ aufnahmen von Licht in Bewegung erstellen kann .
Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-61.703014): I &apos;m going to show you a new kind of design that &apos;s used to be a series of new tools that are made in the world , and it &apos;s a very difficult way to do .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-66.088348): so we can go through the camera and see the lights on the screen , and we can see our own own little bit of the sky , and we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on in the back of the room ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-264.760803): and if I can take a little bit of a laser -- a little bit of a magnetic field , a laser -- and it &apos;s a very simple , very short @-@ term version of the universe -- and it &apos;s going to be able to take a few light @-@ down @-@ line , and that &apos;s the only one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half @-@ a @-@ half @-@ dimensional , and @-@ time @-@ by @-@ a @-@ by @-@ time @-@ a @-@ by @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ by @-@ half @-@ half @-@ time @-@ time @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by @-@ time @-@ time @-@ time @-@ time @-@ time @-@ by @-@ by @-@ the @-@ time @-@ time @-@ the @-@ by @-@ by @-@ the @-@ the @-@ by @-@ by @-@ by
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-45.229515): so if you take this kind of a big bottle , and then you put this into your pocket that would be made out of the bottle .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-10.955591): how does it look like a light bulb ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-4.554119): so , this whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-83.340103): and it &apos;s a little bit like this : if you take a long time , you can see the amount of energy that we &apos;ve been able to do this in the last 10 years , and then you can see this little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a human body .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-19.172258): no , no , the marketing company is not going to do this .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-20.115986): so , this is a little bit of a lot of time , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-68.575928): the second one of the three @-@ dimensional code is that we put a little bit of the metal , and then it &apos;s going to be put into the process of the entire life .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-30.547184): and in the middle of the room , you get to the bottom of the surface and you see the lights .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-33.951405): and the most expensive thing is that they can put a lot of time and put it in the back .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-16.972126): and you can see that the camera is in the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-49.999611): and the winds are moving out of the line , and the parts of the world are actually very close to the edges of the room .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-59.937031): so if you take a picture of the same thing , you &apos;ll see the same thing that &apos;s going to take a 10 @-@ year @-@ old and then take a little bit of time , and then you can see what &apos;s going on ?
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-7.528115): a day , no one , no one .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-37.222538): it &apos;s a very nice little bit -- a little bit of a p@@ ung@@ ed , in the middle of the film .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-11.294177): and how does it be a little bit of plastic ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-26.247999): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air , and the color of the street .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-13.442560): it &apos;s like if you put a stone in a rock .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-63.463703): I would like to say that this is a kind of a picture of a human , and it &apos;s a kind of a kind of thing that would be like to be a shadow .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-74.169937): but if you look at the blue box , you &apos;ll see that the red line is that they &apos;re not going to be able to get a little bit more , and then you &apos;re going to be able to get the same thing .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-40.526508): why is this ? and the reason is that the light is because it &apos;s a piece of paper that &apos;s coming back and forth .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-77.431114): so , if you go to the lab , you can see that the light @-@ made @-@ go @-@ out @-@ in @-@ the @-@ shelf , and you can see that it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s going to be a little bit more efficient .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-13.086283): so what &apos;s the camera that I &apos;ve got to do with my camera ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-87.194603): so , if you look at a long time , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a long @-@ term , but if you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit of the sun , you can &apos;t see it , you &apos;re going to have a little bit more efficient than you &apos;re going to do it .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-102.195503): so we &apos;re going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;m going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take this data and put it into a little bit of a little bit of a few @-@ dimensional , and we &apos;ve got to try to make it more powerful .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.331955): and we can put all this stuff on the right and do some very quick things .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-16.649879): so , the name is going to be run .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-44.602482): and the other things can be a little bit more powerful than the lights , but could we create a new way of being a new one ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.307971): the idea is that we can make light out of the window .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-78.167030): and if you go back to the center , you can see that the space is going to be coming back and forth , and then we &apos;re going to be able to get back into the window of the entire piece of the building .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-15.709321): and this is not a science fiction . we &apos;ve got to see it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-10.467052): on the left , we &apos;re going to get the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-26.687275): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to take the camera out of the window .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-57.845741): and the first thing that we had was done in the &apos; 70s was a new database of these wonderful things called &quot; The Un@@ cle . &quot;
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-160.455688): so you can take this light and put the light into the window , and then you &apos;ll get a little bit of the wind , and you can see that the light will be made in the back of the window , and then the light will be completely in@@ scri@@ bed , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more open , and then we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of the same of the same .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-28.847771): and when we get to the camera , it &apos;s a big camera that &apos;s actually a big one .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-19.428677): it &apos;s a great way to do it in the world and see the same thing .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-48.498413): but the way we do it is to the point of the hall , but we don &apos;t know how to get the object , and the rest of us .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-129.214767): if we can take a camera , we can take a camera , and see how we can actually take this piece of light , and then we can see the same piece of light , and then we can see the same thing that we can actually see in the room , and we can actually see the same thing that &apos;s going to do with this piece of light .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-3.223083): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.143225): so this is the actual app .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-157.164459): we can see that we can see in the process of the first time we can see the world where we can go back and see the air @-@ made , and we can see the same thing that we can do in the air , and we can see the next step in the air , and we can see the next step in the air , and we can actually see the way we can make out of the future .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-88.693481): but it &apos;s a little bit more important than the technology of the subject , because it &apos;s a very important part of the technology that &apos;s been called to the first step of the computer , and this is a new kind of a new field of science .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-145.249084): so , as a scientist , the science of science , is a whole new field of science , and we can see that there &apos;s a whole lot of images that we &apos;ve seen in the universe , and we can &apos;t just use this whole collection of images , and we can actually get a little bit of the technology that &apos;s going to be able to do with the same idea of the universe .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-8.338443): but it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-21.467943): if you look at these waves , you can see the waves coming from the road .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-11.311109): the things that we can go to .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-3.527341): what &apos;s going on ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-45.282841): and it &apos;s been that we could put a lot of light in the early universe , and I thought , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a pretty good thing .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-68.685768): the point is that the universe is in the world , and the way you put in the room is to make a difference between the user and the things that we &apos;re going to be able to do .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-133.770462): so , if you can take a new perspective , and we can take the idea of the world , we &apos;ve been able to take the idea of the new ideas , and we &apos;ve been able to take the data out of the world , and we &apos;ve got to be able to do that , and we &apos;ve got to be able to do that in the last few years .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-5.074776): it &apos;s time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-6.959778): there are many ways of helping our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-31.357025): we don &apos;t have any side of the road , but we don &apos;t have to be able to do the same way .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .

Src: die Projekte entstanden aus meinen Fragen , wie , wie viel Miete zahlen meine Nachbarn ?
Ground Truth: and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
Predicted (-26.918312): the projects I started to ask , how many of them are going to run their own way ?
Ground Truth: how can we l@@ end and borrow more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
Predicted (-21.111584): how do we need to get more and more without any other ?
Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-21.548672): how do we take away from the urban and the buildings that make us better .
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-37.416355): how do we create our lives and our communities that are able to make our lives and to make our own lives ?

Ground Truth: the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America .
Predicted (-33.963692): and the most interesting part of the city is that they &apos;re living in the world , and they &apos;re also a very small city .
Ground Truth: I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a ni@@ cer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
Predicted (-53.140011): I &apos;ve been working on this , and I &apos;ve got to do something that &apos;s going to be a little bit of my life , and I think it &apos;s going to be a little bit more like this .

Ground Truth: in 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
Predicted (-12.764437): and finally , I had a chance to do it .
Ground Truth: her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
Predicted (-26.799709): she was a woman who was in her mother , and she was like she was a woman .
Ground Truth: and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
Predicted (-42.962090): I thought I &apos;d be a lot of joy and joy and joy , and I &apos;ve been thinking about this , and I &apos;ve been thinking about the potential for life .
Ground Truth: but I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .

Ground Truth: I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day @-@ to @-@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
Predicted (-26.362064): it &apos;s a constant point to keep in mind , and it &apos;s important to be true .
Ground Truth: so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board and sten@@ c@@ iled it with a fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ blank sentence : &quot; before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
Predicted (-129.903748): and I &apos;d run through the new way of making a new piece of paper , and I would say , &quot; I can take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;ll see that the guy in the room would be able to take a look at the same time , and then I can see that I can &apos;t get a difference . &quot;
Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-40.726131): I don &apos;t know if I was a little bit about the helicopter , and the other thing was that they were walking around the world .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
Predicted (-18.006468): I &apos;d like to share with you some of the voices that are coming out of the wall .
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be tried for pi@@ racy . &quot;
Predicted (-27.652473): &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the store , &quot; I &apos;m going to get rid of a chicken . &quot;
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to stra@@ ddle the International Date Line . &quot;

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s ca@@ val@@ ry . &quot;
Predicted (-21.311943): &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; I &apos;m a damn damn thing . &quot;
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Predicted (-13.196050): &quot; well , I &apos;m going to be able to do anything . &quot;
Ground Truth: so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
Predicted (-75.854568): and this was a place where the joy of life was to be , and I would have to be able to take the people and to come back and to the comfort of the joy and the joy of the people .
Src: es geht darum zu wissen , dass man nicht allein ist .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
Predicted (-10.219899): it &apos;s about you that you don &apos;t know .
Src: es geht darum , unsere Nachbarn zu verstehen und zwar auf eine neue und auf@@ schluss@@ reiche Art und Weise .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enli@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
Predicted (-29.767551): it &apos;s about our relationship to the city and the way we get to a little bit of a different perspective .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
Predicted (-39.283367): it &apos;s about the way that we think about and how we do it , and it &apos;s important to be the way we think about ourselves .
Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-103.970116): I &apos;ve got this idea that I &apos;ve been working on a few years ago , and I &apos;ve got a bunch of people in the United States , and I &apos;ve got this idea of the world , and we &apos;ve got a bunch of women who are working together in the open @-@ source software , and we can put together a building .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-48.875206): we have the opportunity to do our own lives , and we have to have a lot of choices and how we have to do our own decisions .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-19.051270): the other one is the most important thing we have to do is to change the lives of people .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-46.665073): there &apos;s a lot more time in the brain , and the more important thing to do is to be able to look at the same time , and to think about what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-65.442551): we &apos;re always talking about the things that we &apos;re talking about , and I think it &apos;s not just about the case of the death of the day , but it &apos;s a lot of the reason we &apos;re going to do .
Src: der Gedanke an den Tod verdeutlicht uns das Leben .
Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-15.047554): the conclusion of life is that we think about the death .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-78.654282): the challenges of our minds are about the world , and we are going to help us to create a better way to help ourselves and to live more and more and more of our lives , and to help people to live with them .

Ground Truth: thank you .

Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.330904): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-38.632881): so I &apos;m a little bit more interested in the problem with the English language , which is a key thing that we do with .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-6.734986): no , we know what we &apos;re doing .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-12.943651): so I &apos;m going to talk to you today about the process .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-7.851835): it &apos;s a tough thing .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-55.208660): we &apos;re just a little bit of the dance of the B@@ ic@@ ic@@ os@@ l@@ l@@ it , and you can see it .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-46.661743): so , in a very common sense , a broad set of skills , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to have a shared connection .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-57.908188): and so , in fact , the most powerful thing that &apos;s been done in this case , it &apos;s a very powerful way to do it in the world .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-15.461916): and so , many of you have been working on this technology .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-99.256264): there are millions of people who are dying in the world , and yet , in the same age , we have a lot of damage to the heart , and the disease , and the ability to get to the same disease , and then we can get a little bit more positive .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-60.141064): so we have to do this , and we have to have a better understanding of what &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s the case of the problem , if we have a good thing to do .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-68.145264): and it &apos;s not a good thing , but if you have a lot of brain @-@ related , you can &apos;t have a little bit of a little bit of a drug that &apos;s called the brain .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-34.607601): you can &apos;t do it , and you have to do it , and it &apos;s not a product that &apos;s done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-13.332955): but what if we had to do with the patient &apos;s brain ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-35.066772): and I would be able to take a car that would be used to do this as a medical school .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-22.918371): it was a little bit of a hospital that would be de@@ par@@ able .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-18.922291): it &apos;s so much to be able to do this in the U.S.
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-66.046753): so I &apos;m going to try to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do something in the most basic way , because we &apos;re in the field of the field , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-12.107134): so here &apos;s a video of the pin@@ line .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-103.937737): and if the sound is a little bit like this , we can take a word , and we can put it in the same way , because we can take a look like a little bit of the h@@ ells , and we can put the eggs in the heart of the brain .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-15.422297): and as a result , it &apos;s a tremendous amount of training .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-10.871075): remember , when you learn how to live .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-49.022587): and the sound that you can see is the same thing that we can see , and the left @-@ hand side is the control of the skin .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-30.779509): and in the same way , you can see a little bit of a single @-@ hand side .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-3.820841): we see the same thing .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-15.046491): the cl@@ oning is the age of voice .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-31.651005): and the body is a bit more nuanced and it &apos;s a bit of the case .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-144.891525): so this can be the same , and the ability to read through the software , and the whole system is now now a lot of different kinds of skills , and yet , in fact , that we can have a new memory of the brain , and it &apos;s a lot of feedback that &apos;s been used to be able to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-39.991829): so , if you &apos;re using these tests , you can &apos;t have any better answer , but they &apos;re pretty good at the same test .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-9.147141): so , it &apos;s very important .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-8.883434): you don &apos;t have to build a new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-9.688564): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-8.862764): so you can see the same thing .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-15.726441): they &apos;re very fast , and you can see a few minutes .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-13.878168): we &apos;re very good at it , and we &apos;re going to see this .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-19.054291): if you &apos;re a very efficient way , it &apos;s really a lot of stuff .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-11.001278): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-17.506495): we can do this with severe risk of health .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-18.906406): no data can be done before the patient &apos;s license .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-13.687823): we can move through a completely different paradigm .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-39.504349): we can take a long @-@ term genome , and we &apos;ve been able to do the same thing that we &apos;ve done in the first time .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-24.736641): so we &apos;ve been able to take the evidence for the first time to get rid of it .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-30.569378): so let &apos;s take the first step in this game , and we &apos;re going to take the first step in the field .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-58.735809): so , for example , we have a number of children who are using a full @-@ scale , and we have to be able to do this with the same number of neurons .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-20.783428): we &apos;ve got a little bit of the two @-@ thirds of the planet .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-86.061058): if you can get a little bit of a friend , and we can &apos;t have any extra time to get it , and we &apos;ll be able to get a little bit of the time that we &apos;ve had to do with it .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.330904): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-35.892075): if you take the medicines , we &apos;ll say , &quot; Well , how do you get sick and you have to eat them ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-16.568733): what do you do with this little bit of the entire one ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-45.006130): the problem is that when you get to the patient &apos;s brain , you know , it &apos;s a mistake , and you can &apos;t know how to do it .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-8.869477): you can &apos;t even see it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-62.550571): but there &apos;s a little bit of information that we &apos;re doing , and this is a very important thing to do , because we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and this is what we call the most important thing .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-15.341494): now , how does it have any lower income ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.257174): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-103.577606): I &apos;m sure that this guy has been working on , and it &apos;s been done by this , because it &apos;s a fantastic idea that we can do it in the world , and it &apos;s been called the &quot; The E@@ V@@ .@@ V. &quot; -- it &apos;s a tremendous amount of innovation .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-6.853513): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-69.218269): this is the question that you can take -- you can take the phone and see the person who can do with your iPhone , and then send them to the phone , and they can help the children .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-23.077477): I &apos;m here in the middle of the country , and I &apos;m working on the northeast monsoon .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-22.131691): and the background is the most li@@ d in the woods .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-53.049816): the south is the same thing that we &apos;re doing in the south of the Amazon , and it &apos;s a very , very easy way to do the same thing .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-23.504559): the males , the females , and they are the ones that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-4.906935): they kill our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-42.509014): this is the morning , I was a dead accident . and it was the last night that I was in the snow .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-63.982178): the god of mine is the one that we &apos;ve been living with , and the elephant , and the plants , the way we go from the canopy is to our place .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-13.942732): and as a child , I was afraid to speak to shame .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-28.971527): the protect our mother , and they &apos;re the root of the Gulf of Mexico .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.435919): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-16.123905): here &apos;s a man who was killed in the northern hemisphere .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-18.926708): and I think that there &apos;s a lot of conservation in the forest .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-29.978748): and my mother is a man who &apos;s in the forest , and he died with me .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.699461): I had to find a way .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-7.380767): my first idea was to kill fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-23.355839): but I realized that there was no way to help us to get rid of the street .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-8.295501): but I didn &apos;t go . I did .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-19.856602): I was a second person . I thought I could do it with a bird .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-28.704792): I thought that I would be the ones that were going to be a dog .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-6.332071): but the lions are very difficult .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-52.565464): you &apos;ll see the car coming up , and they &apos;re going to see the same thing . and they &apos;re going to go back , and you &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s no way .
Ground Truth: so he jumps in and kills the animals .
Predicted (-8.034545): and they fight and fight .
Ground Truth: so one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
Predicted (-47.519848): I was walking on the side of the boat , and I was walking through the boat , and I was able to take a piece of the boat .
Ground Truth: and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
Predicted (-15.284779): the elephant is not moving .
Src: ich hatte eine Idee .
Ground Truth: so I had an idea .
Predicted (-1.763811): I had a idea .
Ground Truth: since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
Predicted (-74.651703): and so I was a little bit more than a little bit of my life , and I was able to see that I was going to get a little bit of my life , and I was able to get a little bit of the paper .
Src: ich nahm eine alte Auto@@ batterie und einen Ri@@ chtungs@@ an@@ zei@@ ger aus einem Motorrad . der zeigt an , ob man rechts oder links ab@@ biegen will . er blin@@ kt .
Ground Truth: so I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motor@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . it blin@@ ks .
Predicted (-52.948345): I took a little bit of a battery @-@ like @-@ a @-@ person , and you can see it in the middle of the car , and you can &apos;t see it .
Src: und ich besor@@ gte mir einen Schalter , um die Lichter ein- und auszuschalten .
Ground Truth: and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
Predicted (-19.981590): and I thought I had to get a signal and turn out the lights .
Src: das hier ist eine kleine Bir@@ ne aus einer kaput@@ ten Taschen@@ lampe .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flash@@ light .
Predicted (-22.348885): this is a little girl who &apos;s not a little piece of paper .
Src: und dann baute ich alles zusammen .
Ground Truth: so I set up everything .
