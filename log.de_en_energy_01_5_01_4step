Predicted (-53.268055): and it was that , if you were able to help the parents , the students , the women who had lost their own faith .
Ground Truth: to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .

Ground Truth: what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
Predicted (-89.830101): now , the question is , if you look at the last thing , the answer is that the success of the country is the best thing that he &apos;s doing , and it &apos;s not the case that the success of the society is being done .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
Predicted (-22.521196): it &apos;s not our reason to be the perfect thing for our mothers .
Ground Truth: in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Predicted (-66.903320): they &apos;re more likely to be the case of the people who are in the case of the most successful and more inclusive society than their peers are in the case of their own community .

Predicted (-37.969154): I think that the amount of money is not going to be the result of the way you get in the air .
Ground Truth: but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
Predicted (-71.465790): but when I go to school , I &apos;m going to go to the school , and I &apos;m going to be able to see the kids who are in the case of their own , and then they &apos;re going to be a bit more creative .
Ground Truth: to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and bo@@ und@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sol@@ a remind me of that .
Predicted (-41.173553): and I &apos;m a good reason to be the country , and the rest of the world is to go back and visit me .

Ground Truth: I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
Predicted (-48.740211): I was a company that I &apos;ve done in the world , and we &apos;ve done this , and we &apos;ve got a lot of the technology that we &apos;ve done .

Ground Truth: so we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tom@@ atoes and zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini and ...
Predicted (-103.189972): we were in the middle of the country , and we went to the south of the village , and we put this in a very different @-@ h@@ h@@ emo@@ a @-@ gra@@ v@@ u@@ y@@ land , and we put it in the south of the village .
Ground Truth: and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .

Ground Truth: and that &apos;s why the Senate obje@@ cted to it .
Predicted (-11.353401): and so he did the sign .
Ground Truth: they said , that &apos;s ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him President .
Predicted (-14.533392): they said , &quot; You &apos;re not going to be a stupid name .
Ground Truth: this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dig@@ nit@@ aries .
Predicted (-18.565823): this is the battle between the police and the police .
Ground Truth: and who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a silly little title like President of the United States of America ?
Predicted (-40.818092): if you can get a little bit of the president &apos;s name , &quot; What is the best one of the United States ? &quot;
Src: und auch nach 3 Wochen Debatte gab der Senat nicht nach .
Ground Truth: and after three weeks of debate , in the end the Senate did not cave in .
Predicted (-14.125875): and then , in the &apos; 80s , there was no sign .
Ground Truth: instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civili@@ zed nations , whether under Republican or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose custom it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chief magi@@ strate , titles of respect@@ ability -- not bloody President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maje@@ sty of the people of the United States may not be ha@@ zar@@ ded by an appearance of sing@@ ularity , i@@ .@@ e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weir@@ dos .
Predicted (-339.524658): and after the first time , we can &apos;t be able to do it , and we can &apos;t be able to do it , because the president of the United States is not just about the same thing , but the political system of the world , and the only way we can do it is to be able to be able to do not be able to do it , and to be a better , and to be the case of the case of the case of the case of the most successful , and to do not have to do not have to be the case of the world , and to be the most of the case of the case of the case of the case of the case of the pre@@ dis@@ dis@@ dis@@ dis@@ dis@@ dis@@ dis@@ for@@ ci@@ ci@@ ti@@ ti@@ ti@@
Src: man kann davon drei interessante Dinge lernen .
Ground Truth: now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Predicted (-9.384331): you can see a little bit of things .
Ground Truth: first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never form@@ ally endor@@ sed the title of President .
Predicted (-48.594734): and I &apos;m just saying that the best thing I &apos;ve done is to do this -- I &apos;m not going to get any of the last slide .
Ground Truth: Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
Predicted (-27.764153): the president of the Obama administration said that he &apos;s only going to win the answer .
Ground Truth: second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
Predicted (-56.395130): if you think that you can get a new one , then you &apos;ll never be able to get a doctor , and then you &apos;ll have a chance to be done .
Ground Truth: but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
Predicted (-45.769035): and the final thing is that the answer is , is , the last thing that we &apos;re all concerned about is , &quot; Is this the last country ? &quot;
Ground Truth: something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Predicted (-68.746468): and the thing you &apos;ve got to do is to take a lot of the billions of dollars and the world , and the more we have to be doing this is the largest and the most advanced industry .
Ground Truth: reality and history have endo@@ wed that title with gran@@ de@@ ur .
Predicted (-13.128995): and the story is the form of a story .
Src: und so hat der Senat am Ende gewonnen .
Ground Truth: and so the Senate won in the end .
Predicted (-7.878994): and this is the same thing .
Src: sie haben einen respekt@@ ablen Titel bekommen .
Ground Truth: they got their title of respect@@ ability .
Predicted (-8.998404): you have a big deal .
Src: und die andere Sorge des Sen@@ ats , der Anschein von Eigen@@ artigkeit - nun , damals war es so .
Ground Truth: and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of sing@@ ularity -- well , it was a sing@@ ularity back then .
Predicted (-28.638454): and the other side of the world is the one that &apos;s been known as a lot of the time .
Ground Truth: but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
Predicted (-12.358109): but how do you know that a lot of people have gone ?
Src: 14@@ 7 .
Ground Truth: a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
Predicted (-5.653285): it &apos;s eight .
Ground Truth: all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
Predicted (-39.501427): and you know , if you &apos;re going to get to the guys , they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the guy .
Ground Truth: and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Rep@@ res@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
Predicted (-72.400139): and the first thing that the president is losing the law , and yet , if you don &apos;t have any money , you will have to be the case of the United States , it &apos;s a single one .
Ground Truth: and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Predicted (-13.901446): and that &apos;s the difference between what I &apos;m doing , and I &apos;m going to do with you .
Ground Truth: politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Predicted (-51.176632): now , we can understand how to change the reality of the world , and even more words , the reality of the world is not going to be more difficult than anything .
Src: vielen Dank .
Ground Truth: thank you very much .
Predicted (-0.699615): thank you .
Ground Truth: so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebel@@ s to the battle for J@@ al@@ al@@ abad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old veget@@ arian sur@@ fer from Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida .
Predicted (-82.474968): so I went to a little bit of a year @-@ old , and we went to the United States , and a great @-@ time @-@ old @-@ fashioned , which is a great deal with a high @-@ death .
Src: ich tau@@ schte meine schwarzen Con@@ verse Halb@@ schuhe gegen ein Paar braune Leder@@ sand@@ alen und feu@@ erte eine Rakete in Richtung der Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ anz@@ er , die ich nicht einmal sehen konnte .
Ground Truth: I traded my con@@ verse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sand@@ als and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
Predicted (-63.502602): I was a little bit of a p@@ ung@@ ed @-@ wire , and I put a little bit of a box that would be put in the back of the tank .
Src: das war das erste Mal , dass ich in Afghanistan war .
Ground Truth: and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
Predicted (-5.408686): this was the first time I was in Afghanistan .
Ground Truth: long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sle@@ epo@@ vers and Saturday soccer games and fi@@ st@@ fights with ra@@ cist children of the con@@ feder@@ acy and religi@@ o @-@ nation@@ alist demonstrations chan@@ ting , &quot; D@@ own with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning eff@@ igi@@ es of Bre@@ z@@ h@@ ne@@ v before I even knew what it meant .
Predicted (-172.483383): and I was a little bit more than a couple of years ago , and we were able to go to the local and the same thing , and the way we could do with the world , and the black @-@ eyed Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us , and the same thing was to go to the local and go to the street , and to the way we can see a little bit more and a lot of the world .
Src: aber das ist die Geografie des Selbst .
Ground Truth: but this is the geography of self .
Predicted (-5.299428): but the reality is the center .
Ground Truth: and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , red@@ neck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politici@@ zed artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
Predicted (-91.497406): so I &apos;m here , the two @-@ thirds of the country , the former Soviet Union , and the former former Soviet Union , and the one in the United States is a non @-@ governmental , and it &apos;s a very powerful way of the United States .
Ground Truth: now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rain@@ bows ; I want to make art that distur@@ bs identity and challenges authority and ex@@ poses hypo@@ cris@@ y and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ ts reality and even uses kind of an imaginative eth@@ no@@ graphy to try and understand the world that we live in .
Predicted (-104.900948): I think there &apos;s a lot of ways to do this , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this with the power of the world , and you can &apos;t get a lot of the way you can see the world , and it &apos;s a little bit more powerful , and it &apos;s going to be able to do this kind of thing .
Ground Truth: I want to spend a day in the life of a ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster who wears his jihad against the commun@@ ists like pop@@ star bling and uses armed religious inti@@ mi@@ dation and political corruption to make himself rich .
Predicted (-98.288773): I &apos;d like to take a new man , a little bit of the world , and the American co@@ ar@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ gi@@ um , &quot; the great thing to do is to be a little bit of a p@@ ier@@ cing of the world . &quot;
Ground Truth: and where else can the ji@@ ha@@ di gang@@ ster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
Predicted (-76.687004): and if the man is going to be a business @-@ class party , and then we asked the question to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to be a lawyer , &quot; and I &apos;m going to take a job . &quot;
Src: und versuchen , diese Kampagne zu nutzen , um diese Ma@@ fi@@ os@@ i zu ent@@ tar@@ nen , die sich als National@@ hel@@ den ausgeben .
Ground Truth: and try and use this campaign to expose these ma@@ fi@@ os@@ os who are mas@@ quer@@ ading as national heroes .
Predicted (-29.645302): and this is what they call &quot; The Re@@ cords &quot; to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; pay@@ back &quot; and im@@ person@@ ate a police officer , set up a fake Check@@ point on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologi@@ zing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghan@@ is on our behalf .
Predicted (-144.599655): I think we &apos;re going to go to the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. is going to take a look at the local market , and we &apos;re going to try to take a look at the way that the police are going to be able to take a look at the money , and we &apos;re not going to get a lot of money from the U.S. and the U.S. and the local community .
Ground Truth: I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict ch@@ ic .
Predicted (-28.489697): I think that the question of what I &apos;m going to do is look at the conflict in the country .
Ground Truth: the war and the ex@@ patri@@ ate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fo@@ x fur and add it to a fl@@ ack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashion@@ able neo @-@ traditional v@@ ests .
Predicted (-127.097191): and the people who are going to be able to do this with a new kind of open @-@ source , and then we can take a look at the local local and un@@ contacted peoples in the &apos; 80s , and then we could create a new kind of a re@@ mor@@ mon@@ a@@ stery for the city of the city .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheel@@ bar@@ row and putting it on the wall ami@@ d@@ st Ki@@ pling &apos;s call of 18@@ 99 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colon@@ ial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civili@@ ze him a bit .
Predicted (-141.824509): and I can take a look at the &quot; The O@@ de@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ ers &quot; and &quot; The O@@ th@@ th@@ be@@ be@@ be@@ ers &quot; to be part of the National Museum of Modern Art in which he was able to bring out the world of the most powerful and more of their own efforts to bring to this incredible relationship .
Ground Truth: but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , mis@@ interpreted .
Predicted (-17.025785): but in this way , these things are going to be un@@ interrupted .
Src: aber ich tue sie , weil ich muss , weil die Geografie des Selbst es verlangt .
Ground Truth: but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mand@@ ates it .
Predicted (-18.295795): but I do believe it &apos;s because they &apos;re not going to change the way .
Src: das ist meine Last . welche ist Ihre ?
Ground Truth: that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
Predicted (-10.765018): that &apos;s my point . what is your lifestyle ?
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.087217): thank you .
Src: Hi . mein Name ist Cameron Russell und seit einiger Zeit arbeite ich als Model .
Ground Truth: Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Predicted (-29.139420): my name is &quot; Hi , &quot; and I &apos;m sure that &apos;s where I &apos;m a lot of time .
Src: seit 10 Jahren , genau gesagt .
Ground Truth: actually , for 10 years .
Predicted (-14.144691): so , for the last 10 years , it &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
Predicted (-48.290615): and I think this is a little bit of a room that would have been put into this room , and I don &apos;t have to be able to do this .
Ground Truth: so luckily I brought an out@@ fit change .
Predicted (-9.400724): I &apos;m a little bit more nervous .
Ground Truth: this is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
Predicted (-35.473045): this is the moment that you can see a moment , and I &apos;ll be able to tell you how to do this .
Ground Truth: if some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
Predicted (-58.407455): and I &apos;m sure that if you were a lot more , I &apos;d never be able to do this in the &apos; 80s , I &apos;ll just say that this is what I &apos;m going to do .
Ground Truth: I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Predicted (-36.766796): I think it &apos;s very clear that I can put in a very short period , because I think there &apos;s a new way of seeing .
Src: dazu hat nicht jeder die Chance .
Ground Truth: not everybody gets to do that .
Predicted (-9.356528): and no one has to do it .
Ground Truth: these he@@ els are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
Predicted (-18.666679): and the good thing is that they &apos;re not too good at it .
Ground Truth: the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
Predicted (-71.778419): the point is that if you &apos;re in the middle of the head , you &apos;re going to go to the other , and you &apos;re going to get a little bit more , but I &apos;m not going to get to the point .
Src: in Ordnung .
Ground Truth: all right .
Predicted (-1.488507): okay .
Src: warum habe ich das jetzt getan ?
Ground Truth: so why did I do that ?
Predicted (-4.689787): so why did I do that ?
Src: das war peinlich .
Ground Truth: that was awkward .
Predicted (-8.363777): that was a very embarrassing .
Src: nun , es war hoffentlich nicht so peinlich wie dieses Bild .
Ground Truth: well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Predicted (-19.549862): so , I don &apos;t think that this is a pretty dramatic way .
Ground Truth: image is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
Predicted (-17.030579): it &apos;s a very powerful , but it &apos;s a very powerful picture .
Ground Truth: I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
Predicted (-15.891375): I &apos;m sure that all of you have seen in my head .
Src: und auf diesem Bild - ich hatte in Wirklichkeit niemals einen Freund .
Ground Truth: and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
Predicted (-13.613282): and this is a moment where I didn &apos;t know any one .
Ground Truth: I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
Predicted (-45.780510): I was very afraid to go and look at my father and I was looking at the same kind of guy who was sitting in my pocket .
Ground Truth: and of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and imm@@ ut@@ able , has a huge impact on our lives .
Predicted (-104.527573): and as the rest of the day , we can see that there are no more and more and more and more of the ways that we can do it , and I think it &apos;s a little bit more than the way we can do it , and it &apos;s not just a good thing to be able to do .
Ground Truth: so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
Predicted (-11.809155): and it &apos;s too hard to be honest .
Ground Truth: and I am on this stage because I am a model .
Predicted (-10.700673): and I &apos;m standing in the middle of this one .
Ground Truth: I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
Predicted (-45.226677): I &apos;m standing in the middle of this , and I &apos;m a little girl , and I &apos;m a little girl , because I &apos;m a guy in the middle of the room .
Src: ich werde jetzt die Fragen beantworten , die die Leute mir immer stellen , aber auf die ehrliche Art.
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
Predicted (-34.312588): I &apos;m going to ask the questions that are going to be the right thing , but I &apos;m going to ask people to do it .
Src: die erste Frage lautet : &quot; wie wird man ein Model ? &quot;
Ground Truth: so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
Predicted (-6.478141): the first question is , &quot; What are you going to do ? &quot;
Src: ich sage immer : &quot; Oh , ich wurde entdeckt &quot; , aber das bedeutet gar nichts .
Ground Truth: and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was sc@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
Predicted (-19.714375): I said , &quot; Well , I think , &quot; Oh , no , I &apos;m going to do it .
Src: der wahre Grund , wie ich ein Model wurde , ist ein Gewinn in der genetischen Lotterie und ein wichtiges Erbe und vielleicht fragen Sie sich , woraus dieses Erbe besteht .
Ground Truth: the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Predicted (-67.327499): the second thing is that the most important thing is , if you think about a global economic and an economic model , it &apos;s a very important way to be a professional and a professional .
Ground Truth: well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , sl@@ ender figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
Predicted (-89.837601): now , we &apos;ve been working in the same way , and we &apos;re not just a very strong , and yet we &apos;re very happy to see how the growing and the beauty of the way we &apos;re living in a very complex form .
Ground Truth: and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ hing out on .
Predicted (-22.741089): and this is an architect , and it &apos;s been a design for me .
Ground Truth: and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashion@@ ist@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ m@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
Predicted (-67.833199): I think there &apos;s a lot of people who are looking at this , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit more like a mess , and I think , &quot; Oh , you know , there &apos;s a lot of h@@ ells . &quot;
Ground Truth: and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
Predicted (-18.465628): and the first thing you see is that I &apos;m very excited .
Ground Truth: but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hired , and of the 6@@ 77 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
Predicted (-108.304482): but I think that if you &apos;ve been working on a single @-@ scale scale project , the only one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old , and it &apos;s been done with a single one @-@ to @-@ one @-@ half @-@ one @-@ half @-@ year @-@ old , and it &apos;s not just a single single one that &apos;s been done .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
Predicted (-26.127869): the next question is , &quot; When will I come to the future be a more efficient way ? &quot;
Ground Truth: and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
Predicted (-13.598763): and I said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s not the right thing . &quot;
Ground Truth: but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
Predicted (-20.363581): so the other thing I want to say is , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the best way to do this ? &quot;
Ground Truth: you know ? you can be anything .
Predicted (-4.572646): you know what you do ?
Ground Truth: you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a nin@@ ja cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
Predicted (-57.840565): you know , if you &apos;re going to be the first person in the United States , or the C@@ es@@ es@@ es@@ ar , or the next one is a big thing .
Ground Truth: if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Predicted (-50.651199): and if you &apos;re going to get a little bit more , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; No , no , no , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m going to be a lawyer . &quot;
Ground Truth: because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Mei@@ sel .
Predicted (-39.190952): I don &apos;t want to be the best @-@ selling or the best @-@ selling book or the best @-@ selling company .
Ground Truth: saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Power@@ ball when you grow up .
Predicted (-43.466827): and you &apos;ll say , if you &apos;re going to be a bit more likely to get the wrong thing , you &apos;re going to be able to get the word .
Src: man kann es nicht beeinflussen und es ist fantastisch und es ist kein Karriere@@ weg .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
Predicted (-19.737774): you can &apos;t understand it , and it &apos;s not the case . it &apos;s not a great failure .
Ground Truth: I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accum@@ ulated model knowledge , because unlike cardi@@ o @-@ thor@@ ac@@ ic surgeons , it can just be dist@@ illed right into -- right now .
Predicted (-46.769962): I think this is the first time @-@ to @-@ the @-@ world @-@ class system that can be done with your own personal record .
Ground Truth: so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
Predicted (-183.702850): and if you look at the same guy , you can see the robot , and you can see the front line , and then you go back to the front line , and you can see the camera , and then you go back to the front , and he &apos;s going to go back to the front line , and you can see the next one , and the next one is a little bit of the way to be like a little bit of the way , &quot; C@@ res@@ pi@@ cky , and the same . &quot;
Ground Truth: it will look something like this .
Predicted (-2.869749): it looks like this .
Src: hoffentlich weniger komisch als das in der Mitte .
Ground Truth: hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
Predicted (-14.551536): in a way , it &apos;s pretty much better .
Ground Truth: that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Predicted (-5.783890): I didn &apos;t know what this is .
Predicted (-112.651360): and if you &apos;ve got a lot of money , you &apos;ll get a better job , and you &apos;ll see that if you &apos;re going to go back to the &apos; 80s , you &apos;re going to be a little bit better than the word &quot; C@@ ab@@ ab@@ ab@@ ab@@ ab@@ a@@ ther , &quot; and you &apos;re not going to have a good business .
Ground Truth: the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
Predicted (-25.620888): the question is , &quot; When will I tell you that the audience is going to be completely different ? &quot;
Src: und ja , so ziemlich alle Fotos werden re@@ tu@@ schiert , aber das ist nur ein kleiner Teil des Gescheh@@ ens .
Ground Truth: and yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .

Predicted (-25.679268): now , the other thing is , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re going to get people to do it ? &quot;
Ground Truth: I do have too many 8 @-@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .

Predicted (-32.744270): it &apos;s a good thing to say , &quot; Well , it &apos;s great to be great , and it &apos;s a great deal of art . &quot;
Ground Truth: and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
Predicted (-54.931343): it &apos;s all the same thing that we &apos;ve seen , because the whole thing is , &quot; I &apos;m not sure how much we &apos;ve ever been in the moment , because I &apos;m not sure . &quot;
Ground Truth: and I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
Predicted (-17.274231): and I feel that I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time on my own .
Ground Truth: and if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thin@@ ner thi@@ gh@@ s and sh@@ in@@ ier hair , will I be happier ? &quot;
Predicted (-44.812592): and if you think about it , I would have a better life , and if you have a lot of more intelligent and more bizarre ?
Ground Truth: you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thin@@ nest thi@@ gh@@ s and the sh@@ ini@@ est hair and the cool@@ est clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
Predicted (-79.077354): and if you have a little bit of the t@@ wo@@ osh , they &apos;re the ones who are the most beautiful and the most expensive and the ones that are made out of the same thing , and they &apos;re the most beautiful thing .
Ground Truth: so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
Predicted (-131.284821): and I thought that I &apos;d be very hard to do this , because I &apos;m going to be very clear to me , and I &apos;m going to get a little bit more clear , and I &apos;m going to be able to do this , because I &apos;m not going to have a very good job to do this , and I &apos;m not going to get a little bit more honest with the way .
Ground Truth: but mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a legacy of gender and racial oppres@@ sion when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fici@@ aries .
Predicted (-61.164894): it was a very difficult way to deal with a great rise of the country , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to be a very honest part of my own .
Ground Truth: but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
Predicted (-112.690804): I &apos;m sure that I can do this , and I &apos;ve been able to do this , and I &apos;ve been able to be able to do this , and I &apos;ve been able to tell you that I &apos;ve never seen a new career , and I &apos;ve been able to do something like this , and I &apos;ve been able to do that for the last 10 years .
Ground Truth: if there &apos;s a tak@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowle@@ dging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Predicted (-78.958633): if you look at this , you &apos;ll get a little bit of the message , and we can actually get the message from the in@@ version of the power of the way we &apos;re going to be able to get rid of it .

Predicted (-76.283546): after a few months , the death of the day , the first time was destroyed by the way , and it was not a man who was dying and it was filled with the rest of our lives .

Predicted (-57.447411): and a lot of the way that the president has been working on a global fight , and it &apos;s a great deal of the power of the country .
Ground Truth: for four decades Gad@@ da@@ fi &apos;s tyran@@ ni@@ cal regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Liby@@ an society .
Predicted (-64.371956): and so , over the course of the world , the only thing that has been done is that they are also the culture of the social and the social and the political system .

Predicted (-31.708344): I was born a little bit old , and I was born with my old sister , and I was born in a new way .
Src: und nach ein paar Monaten wurde mir klar , dass er anders war .
Ground Truth: and after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
Predicted (-12.285406): and after a few months , I realized that it was very different .
Src: er schrie sehr viel .
Ground Truth: he scre@@ amed a lot .
Predicted (-5.007520): he &apos;s very much .
Ground Truth: he didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Predicted (-33.775112): he would like to do something that was not the same thing , but he was going to be able to do something .
Src: Rem@@ i lebte und regi@@ erte in seiner eigenen Welt , mit seinen eigenen Regeln , und er fand Freude an den kleinsten Dingen , wie etwa , Autos in einer Reihe im Raum aufzustellen , die Waschmaschine anzu@@ starren und alles zu essen , was ihm unter@@ kam .
Ground Truth: Rem@@ i lived and rei@@ g@@ ned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
Predicted (-72.595825): he was working with his friends and his friends , and he had a big relationship to the world , and he was able to take a lot of money , and put it on the other side of the world , and he had to do something like this .
Ground Truth: and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Predicted (-14.577974): and as he was born , it was more and more different .
Ground Truth: yet beyond the tan@@ tr@@ ums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Predicted (-75.631203): but the thing that the thing you &apos;ve seen was that the world was not a complete p@@ ier@@ cing and a little bit of a human , and the thing that he had never seen before .
Ground Truth: extraordinary .
Predicted (-1.252221): it &apos;s extraordinary .
Ground Truth: now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
Predicted (-41.129009): well , I can imagine that I had a chance to be able to see the moments of my life that I had in the audience .
Ground Truth: but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Predicted (-98.283119): but I want to talk about the things that I &apos;ve been talking about , and I &apos;ve got to do with the relationship between the things that are made , and the things that are not about , and I &apos;ve got to do , and I think , &quot; I think , &quot; you know , &quot;
Ground Truth: norm@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
Predicted (-46.221958): so the perception of the difference is that we can &apos;t see the difference between the other and the other one is a bit more important .
Src: es bedeutet nur , dass es eine andere Art von Ri@@ chtig gibt .
Ground Truth: it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
Predicted (-14.292675): it &apos;s just one way to say that there &apos;s a different kind of thing .
Ground Truth: and if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
Predicted (-42.534065): and I &apos;d like to say that if you &apos;re a friend and I can do it , and then you can &apos;t be able to do something .
Ground Truth: you can be extraordinary .
Predicted (-9.835080): you can be a very powerful way .
Ground Truth: because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
Predicted (-72.710526): because , if you &apos;re a little bit of a human , and we &apos;re not going to be a gift , and that &apos;s a gift that we have to be born with the gift of the gift .
Ground Truth: the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Predicted (-30.512165): the amount of time in life is going to be done in the way we go to the situation .
Src: bitte - sagen Sie mir nicht , dass ich normal bin .
Ground Truth: please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Predicted (-14.116694): so , I say , &quot; I don &apos;t think that .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.614740): thank you .
Ground Truth: Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet p@@ ier@@ cing through an apple , and exposure just a million@@ th of a second .
Predicted (-85.923225): and he was doing a little bit of a pro@@ p , and then he &apos;s going to take a piece of a piece of a piece of a novel that was made by a complete de@@ bu@@ ckle .
Ground Truth: but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
Predicted (-51.370010): but the next time , we &apos;re going to see a billion years , and a half a million people are dying in a second , and you can &apos;t see a single one of the world .
Src: ich stelle Ihnen eine neue Art der Fotografie vor , die F@@ em@@ to @-@ Fotografie , eine neue Ab@@ bild@@ ungste@@ chnik , die so schnell ist , dass sie Zeit@@ lu@@ pen@@ aufnahmen von Licht in Bewegung erstellen kann .
Ground Truth: I present you a new type of photography , fem@@ to @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
Predicted (-72.944092): I &apos;m going to show you a new kind of industrial design that &apos;s used to be a series of new tools that are made in the world , and it &apos;s a very difficult way to create a whole range of pieces .
Ground Truth: and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Predicted (-62.823013): so we can go out and see the lights on the screen , and we can see our own little piece of the screen , and we can see what &apos;s going on in the back of the room ?
Src: wenn ich jetzt einen Laser@@ pointer nehme und ihn in einer billion@@ stel Sekunde an- und aus@@ schalte - das sind mehrere F@@ em@@ tos@@ ekunden - , erschaffe ich ein Paket von Photonen , das kaum einen Millimeter breit ist und dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , wird sich in Lichtgeschwindigkeit fort@@ bewegen , und - wie gesagt - eine Million Mal schneller als ein normales Proje@@ kti@@ l .
Ground Truth: now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ tos@@ econds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that pack@@ et of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Predicted (-150.638000): and if I can take a little bit of a magnetic field , I &apos;ll take a little bit of a mouse -- and it &apos;s a very simple , very short @-@ term , and then I &apos;ll take a new electron -- a new trajectory that &apos;s going to be able to take a light @-@ powered electron , and a half @-@ dimensional , and a half @-@ dimensional picture .
Ground Truth: now , if you take that bullet and take this pack@@ et of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons sh@@ atter into this bottle ?
Predicted (-56.145775): so if you take this kind of a big bottle of the bubble , and then you put this into your pocket , it would be a little bit more like this .
Src: wie sieht Licht in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe aus ?
Ground Truth: how does light look in slow motion ?
Predicted (-14.391491): how do you look at the light of the night ?
Src: also , dieses ganze Ereignis -
Ground Truth: now , the whole event
Predicted (-4.819031): so , this whole event .
Ground Truth: now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ os@@ econd - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
Predicted (-116.720139): and so , you know , if you &apos;re going to take a little bit of a long time , you can see the same thing , and then you can see a little bit of the same thing that you &apos;ve made in the universe , and then you can take a little bit of the energy that &apos;s going to take a little bit of the last 10 years .
Src: nein , Coca @-@ Cola hat diese Forschung nicht finanziert .
Ground Truth: but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
Predicted (-19.286201): no , no , the marketing company is not going to do this .
Src: also , in diesem Film passiert sehr viel , also lassen Sie mich das analysieren und Ihnen zeigen was passiert .
Ground Truth: now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
Predicted (-20.735710): so , this is a little bit of a lot of time , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a pack@@ et of photons that start traveling through and that start sc@@ attering inside .
Predicted (-68.169060): the second one is that the size of the bubble is going to take a piece of paper , and then we put it into a little bit of the metal that &apos;s going to be put into the back .
Ground Truth: some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these rip@@ ples of waves .
Predicted (-28.462759): and in the middle of the room , you get to the bottom of the surface and the lights .
Src: viele der Photonen erreichen letztendlich den Ver@@ schluss der Flasche und explodieren in verschiedene Richtungen .
Ground Truth: many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
Predicted (-32.902573): and the most expensive thing is that they can take a lot of time and put it in the back .
Ground Truth: as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s boun@@ cing around inside .
Predicted (-24.967907): and you see , the little bit of the air that &apos;s built in the air .
Ground Truth: meanwhile , the rip@@ ples are traveling on the table , and because of the refle@@ ctions at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the refle@@ ctions are focused .
Predicted (-47.972691): and the contrast is that the amount of space that you see in the middle of the room is filled with a lot of the l@@ amps .
Ground Truth: now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
Predicted (-74.727211): so if you take a picture of the same thing , you can take a little bit of the C@@ C@@ C@@ E , and then you &apos;ll see the same thing that &apos;s going to do , and then you &apos;ll have to do something more than 10 times .
Src: einen Tag , eine Woche ? nein , ein ganzes Jahr .
Ground Truth: a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
Predicted (-7.876325): a day , no one , no one .
Ground Truth: it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
Predicted (-34.730343): it &apos;s a very nice little bit -- a little bit of a p@@ ung@@ ed , a little bit of motion .
Src: und wie sieht es mit etwas Still@@ leben @-@ Fotografie aus ?
Ground Truth: and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
Predicted (-10.579039): and how do you see a little bit of plastic ?
Ground Truth: you can watch the rip@@ ples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
Predicted (-30.760475): you can see that the walls are coming out of the air and the h@@ ells and the balls .
Src: es ist , als wenn man einen Stein in einen Teich wirft .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
Predicted (-13.983604): it &apos;s like if you put a stone in a pool .
Ground Truth: I thought , this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
Predicted (-67.481705): I would like to say that this is a kind of a picture of a human , and it &apos;s a kind of a kind of thing that would be like to be a shadow of the skull .
Ground Truth: but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light was@@ hes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
Predicted (-65.973534): but if you look at the blue box , you &apos;ll see that the red line is that they &apos;re going to be completely in@@ und@@ ated , and you &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit more .
Src: warum ist das so ? weil die Tom@@ ate reif ist und das Licht in ihr umher springt und nach einigen billion@@ stel Sekunden wieder herauskommt .
Ground Truth: why is that ? because the tomato is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is boun@@ cing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-41.177975): why is this ? and the case is that the light is a piece of paper that &apos;s coming back and forth .
Ground Truth: so , in the future , when this fem@@ to @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually touching it .
Predicted (-80.228500): so , if you go to the lab , you can see the light @-@ made @-@ go @-@ out @-@ in @-@ the @-@ shelf , and you can see that it &apos;s a single one where it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get a car .
Src: wie also hat mein Team am MIT diese Kamera gebaut ?
Ground Truth: so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Predicted (-13.596471): so what &apos;s the camera that I &apos;ve got to do with my camera ?
Ground Truth: now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
Predicted (-101.693230): so , if you look at a long time , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a long @-@ term , but if you &apos;re a little bit more advanced , you can see that they &apos;re not going to be a little bit more efficient , you &apos;re going to have a little bit of a little bit more than a little bit of a long time .
Src: also wir machen Folgendes : wir schicken dieses Proje@@ kti@@ l , dieses Photonen @-@ Paket , million@@ fach und zeichnen das wieder und wieder mit sehr cleverer Synchron@@ isation auf und diese Gig@@ abytes von Daten kombinieren wir rechn@@ erisch , um diese F@@ em@@ to @-@ Videos zu erstellen , die ich Ihnen gezeigt habe .
Ground Truth: so , what we do is we send that bullet , those pack@@ et of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchron@@ ization , and from the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data , we compu@@ ta@@ tionally wea@@ ve together to create those fem@@ to @-@ videos I showed you .
Predicted (-102.434280): so we &apos;re going to take this data , and we &apos;re going to take this little bit of a piece of paper , and we &apos;ve got this little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a re@@ mark , and then we &apos;ve got to try to make this new version of the data that we &apos;ve done .
Ground Truth: and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
Predicted (-21.394630): and we can put all this stuff on the right and see a lot of things .
Src: also , Superman kann fliegen .
Ground Truth: so , Superman can fly .
Predicted (-16.925863): so , the name is C@@ enti@@ able .
Ground Truth: some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
Predicted (-47.887608): and the other thing can be more powerful than the lights , and the new ones can be a little bit more powerful than the lights ?
Ground Truth: the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
Predicted (-11.631449): the idea is that we can make light out of the window .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
Predicted (-66.577835): and if you go back to the center , you can go back and go back to the center of the room , and then the whole piece of the room is going to be able to get through the air .
Src: und das ist keine Science @-@ Fiction . wir haben es sogar schon gebaut .
Ground Truth: and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
Predicted (-16.660423): and this is not the science fiction . we &apos;ve got some of it .
Src: links sehen Sie unsere F@@ em@@ to @-@ Kamera .
Ground Truth: on the left , you see our fem@@ to @-@ camera .
Predicted (-8.478473): the left is the camera .
Ground Truth: there &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
Predicted (-27.295071): the wall is a window , and we &apos;re going to take the camera out of the window .
Ground Truth: so after our paper was published in Nature Comm@@ unic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ ghted by Nat@@ ure@@ .com , and they created this animation .
Predicted (-76.433701): and the first thing that we had was done was this &quot; The O@@ .C. &quot; and it was made by the way that we &apos;ve made this new collection of &quot; The Ori@@ gin of Spe@@ cies .
Ground Truth: we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the pack@@ et of the photons , they will sc@@ atter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ atter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that sc@@ attered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
Predicted (-141.382050): so you can take this light @-@ made , and you can see that the light will be put into a little bit of a single @-@ line , and then the light will be able to get a little bit of the wind , and then the light will be able to get a little bit more open , and then we &apos;re going to get to get a little bit more open .
Ground Truth: and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our fem@@ to @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
Predicted (-40.240707): and so , if we &apos;re a camera , we &apos;re going to have a very big camera , and it &apos;s a very powerful device .
Ground Truth: it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Predicted (-21.691200): it &apos;s a great way to do it in the world and you can see the same thing .
Ground Truth: and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
Predicted (-56.342804): but the way we do to the distance , and the point is that we don &apos;t know the rest of the room , but we &apos;re not going to be able to see the way .
Ground Truth: by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Predicted (-123.838913): if we can take a camera , we can take a camera , and see how we can actually take this piece of light , and then we can see the same piece of light , and then we can see the same thing that we can see here , and then we can actually see the camera that &apos;s going to be able to do this kind of thing .
Ground Truth: can we see it in full 3D ?
Predicted (-3.479796): can we see it in 3D ?
Src: also das hier ist unsere Re@@ konstruktion .
Ground Truth: so this is our reconstruction .
Predicted (-7.046616): so this is the actual app .
Ground Truth: now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build end@@ os@@ copes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ os@@ copes .
Predicted (-158.464081): we can see that we can see the first step in the process of the air , and we can see the way we can see the first thing that we can see in the air , and we can go back and see where we can go back and see the next phase of the air , and we can see the next step in the air , and we can actually see the way we can be able to do better understand .
Ground Truth: but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to @-@ photography as really a new imaging mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Predicted (-78.620972): but the more important thing is that this is the case of the technology , and it &apos;s a very important part of the technology that &apos;s been used to be a little bit more complicated than the first step of the computer .
Ground Truth: now , like Doc Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gi@@ gab@@ ytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those rip@@ ples . remember , the time between each of those rip@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
Predicted (-159.886200): so , as a scientist , the science of science , is a complete science fiction , and we can see that the whole universe is a lot of time , and we can &apos;t see the whole collection of the digital digital , and then we can actually put a lot of images in the universe , and we can &apos;t see the same thing that &apos;s going to be able to do with this incredible technology .
Src: aber es passiert hier auch etwas Lu@@ stiges .
Ground Truth: but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
Predicted (-8.612179): but it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
Src: wenn Sie sich diese Wellen unter dem Flas@@ chen@@ versch@@ luss anschauen , sehen Sie , dass sich die Wellen von uns weg bewegen .
Ground Truth: when you look at the rip@@ ples under the cap , the rip@@ ples are moving away from us .
Predicted (-22.028873): if you look at these waves , you can see the waves coming from the road .
Src: die Wellen sollten sich zu uns hin bewegen .
Ground Truth: the rip@@ ples should be moving towards us .
Predicted (-12.775446): and the things that we can go to .
Src: was passiert hier ?
Ground Truth: what &apos;s going on here ?
Predicted (-3.466132): what &apos;s going on here ?
Ground Truth: it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
Predicted (-50.530029): and it &apos;s been that we could put a lot of the same thing , and I thought , in fact , that we had a pretty complex universe .
Ground Truth: the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes revers@@ ed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this distor@@ tion .
Predicted (-90.537552): the point is that the world is in the same way that we put in the world , and the way you can see the amount of information , and the way you put into the room , and the more you can do it .
Ground Truth: so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visu@@ alizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ ix@@ els in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
Predicted (-146.000809): so , if you can take a new perspective , the idea of the world , the new set of ideas that we &apos;ve been able to do , and we &apos;ve got to be able to take the idea of the new and re@@ constructing our own own , and we &apos;ve got to go back to the next generation of the world , and we &apos;ve got to be able to do that .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about time . thank you .
Predicted (-5.660813): it &apos;s time . thank you .
Ground Truth: there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
Predicted (-7.731599): there are many ways of helping our lives .
Ground Truth: we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
Predicted (-28.776642): we don &apos;t have any side of the road , but we don &apos;t have any way to go to the street .
Src: in den letzten Jahren habe ich versucht mehr mit meinen Nachbarn zu teilen und dabei Dinge wie Auf@@ kleber , Sch@@ ab@@ l@@ onen und Kreide zu verwenden .
Ground Truth: so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ckers , sten@@ cils and chalk .
Predicted (-63.894451): I &apos;ve been working on the Internet and I &apos;ve been trying to keep the same thing , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of money and the way to get out of the box .
Src: die Projekte entstanden aus meinen Fragen , wie , wie viel Miete zahlen meine Nachbarn ?
Ground Truth: and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
Predicted (-31.223785): the projects I started to ask , how many of them are going to run their way from my business ?
Ground Truth: how can we l@@ end and borrow more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
Predicted (-21.579939): how do we need to get more and more without any other way ?
Ground Truth: how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
Predicted (-26.811680): how do we take away from the urban and the creative world and make them feel better .
Ground Truth: and how can we share more of our hopes for our vac@@ ant stor@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Predicted (-38.488438): how do we create our lives and our communities that are able to make our lives and to make our own lives ?

Predicted (-27.899260): she was a woman who was a mother , and she was like she was a woman .
Ground Truth: and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
Predicted (-52.568710): I thought that I &apos;d been a lot more about the joy of life and the joy of life , and I &apos;ve been thinking about this , and I &apos;ve been doing a lot of the joy .
Ground Truth: but I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
Predicted (-18.959318): but it seems to be a little bit of hard to keep on the road .
Src: es ist leicht , sich im Alltag zu verlieren und zu vergessen , was wirklich wichtig ist .
Ground Truth: I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day @-@ to @-@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
Predicted (-22.986183): it &apos;s a good thing to keep it alive , and that &apos;s the right thing .
Ground Truth: so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board and sten@@ c@@ iled it with a fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ blank sentence : &quot; before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
Predicted (-113.244232): and I &apos;d run through the new way of doing this , and I would take a little bit of a new book , and I would say , &quot; I can take a little bit of a piece of paper , and I &apos;ll see that the world would be able to go back to the end of the day . &quot;
Ground Truth: I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
Predicted (-45.725189): I &apos;m not sure that I &apos;d be able to see the movie was going on , and the other thing that was coming out of the boat .
Ground Truth: and I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
Predicted (-19.716774): I &apos;d like to share with you some of the voices that are made out of the people .
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be tried for pi@@ racy . &quot;
Predicted (-50.750271): &quot; I &apos;m going to go to the &quot; eu@@ th@@ a@@ dage &quot; because I &apos;m going to get a bit of a bit of a mess .
Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to stra@@ ddle the International Date Line . &quot;

Ground Truth: &quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
Predicted (-13.362236): &quot; well , I &apos;m going to be able to do anything . &quot;
Ground Truth: so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
Predicted (-64.376587): and this was a place where the joy of the people who were going to be and to be able to take the joy and the joy of the people who were in the room .
Src: es geht darum zu wissen , dass man nicht allein ist .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .

Src: es geht darum , unsere Nachbarn zu verstehen und zwar auf eine neue und auf@@ schluss@@ reiche Art und Weise .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enli@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
Predicted (-39.224159): it &apos;s about our relationship to the world , and it &apos;s a little bit of a way to go and try and make it more beautiful .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contempl@@ ation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
Predicted (-40.473740): it &apos;s about the way that we think about how to do it and to be a place where we are and how we do it .
Ground Truth: I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Predicted (-101.100647): I &apos;ve got this idea that I &apos;ve been working on a few years ago , and I &apos;ve got a bunch of people who are going to take this open @-@ source software and put together in the United States , and we &apos;ve got this idea of the world , and we &apos;ve got a lot of women in the world .
Ground Truth: together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Predicted (-34.674057): we have a lot of the way we &apos;ve got to do our minds and how to make our decisions .
Src: zwei der wert@@ vollsten Dinge , die wir haben , sind Zeit und die Beziehungen zu anderen Menschen .
Ground Truth: two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Predicted (-19.656822): the other thing is that we have the most valuable things we have to live in .
Src: in einer Welt mit zunehmen@@ den Ablen@@ kungen ist es wichtiger als je zuvor , die Dinge mit dem richtigen Blick zu betrachten und daran zu denken , dass das Leben kurz und empfindlich ist .
Ground Truth: in our age of increasing distra@@ ctions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Predicted (-44.415356): there &apos;s a lot more time in the brain , and the more important thing to do is to be more likely to be able to understand what &apos;s going on .
Ground Truth: death is something that we &apos;re often discoura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Predicted (-67.457588): we &apos;re going to talk about the truth , and the reason is that we &apos;re still dying , but I &apos;m not going to talk about the fact that we &apos;re going to be able to do something about the death of the death .

Ground Truth: thinking about death clari@@ fies your life .
Predicted (-14.403801): the conclusion is that life is the cause of death .
Ground Truth: our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Predicted (-96.879921): the challenges of our minds are about the world , and the way we think about ourselves is that we can help people to live in a more open way , and we can help help people to live and help ourselves and to live more and more and more and more of our lives .

Ground Truth: thank you .

Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.614740): thank you .
Ground Truth: so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
Predicted (-40.641399): so I &apos;m thinking about a little bit of a problem with social problem , which is a key thing that we &apos;re doing with .
Ground Truth: no one knows what the hell we do .
Predicted (-4.229618): no one is what we do .
Ground Truth: so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
Predicted (-19.765648): so I &apos;m going to talk to you today about the way I &apos;m going to try to do this .
Ground Truth: so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
Predicted (-7.961600): it &apos;s a tough thing .
Ground Truth: we delight at ballet virtu@@ os@@ os and tap dancers you will see later on .
Predicted (-44.661263): we &apos;re just a little bit of the dance of the co@@ stum@@ es and the way you can see it .
Ground Truth: now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suit@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Predicted (-49.810265): so , in a very common sense , a broad set of skills , and it &apos;s a very powerful way to have a shared shared value .
Ground Truth: now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling , who was a virtu@@ oso ballet dancer in his time .
Predicted (-108.250343): and so , in fact , the most powerful thing that &apos;s been done in this case , it &apos;s a very powerful way to do it in the face of a life @-@ like @-@ to @-@ have @-@ have @-@ a @-@ day @-@ old , and it &apos;s a little bit of a human being .
Ground Truth: so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
Predicted (-16.436092): and so , many of you have been working on this technology .
Ground Truth: however , there are 6.@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able weakness , tre@@ m@@ or , rigi@@ dity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-103.280785): there are millions of people who are dying over the world , and yet , in the world , have a tremendous amount of disease , and we have a lot of damage to the heart , and the more powerful , and the more powerful thing that we can do is to be able to do it .
Ground Truth: we need to be able to measure progression obje@@ ctively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
Predicted (-53.390091): we have to do the right thing , and if we have a good thing to do it , it &apos;s a good thing to do , we can do it in the future .
Ground Truth: but fru@@ strat@@ ingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurolog@@ ist test .
Predicted (-88.555565): and it &apos;s so bad that you can &apos;t have a lot of brain @-@ related , and if you have a lot of neuro@@ modul@@ ator , you can &apos;t have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a drug that &apos;s been called the brain .
Ground Truth: you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
Predicted (-44.982006): you can &apos;t do it , and you have to do it , and it &apos;s not a product that &apos;s done . it &apos;s not going to be done .
Ground Truth: but what if patients could do this test at home ?
Predicted (-19.266014): but what if we had to do this , would you get the patient ?
Ground Truth: now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
Predicted (-41.130135): and it would be a better way to get the car , and if you could do this , you could do that .
Ground Truth: no expensive staff time required .
Predicted (-22.750797): it was a little bit of a hospital that would be de@@ par@@ able .
Ground Truth: takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s clinic to do it .
Predicted (-19.131561): it &apos;s so much to be able to do this in the U.S.
Ground Truth: so what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an Stri@@ pling .
Predicted (-67.498520): so I &apos;m going to try to make sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do this in the right way , because we &apos;re going to have some kind of un@@ conventional way to do this in the field of the field .
Src: hier sehen Sie ein Video der vibri@@ erenden Stimm@@ li@@ ppen .
Ground Truth: so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Predicted (-12.229275): so here &apos;s a video of the pin@@ line .
Ground Truth: now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOX@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
Predicted (-102.031624): and if you have a little bit of the brain , we can take a word , and we can put it in the same way that we can get a little bit of the h@@ ells , and we can get rid of the h@@ ells , and we have to do that .
Ground Truth: and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
Predicted (-16.227993): and as a result , it &apos;s a tremendous amount of work .
Src: denken Sie daran , wie lange ein Kind braucht , bis es sprechen lernt .
Ground Truth: I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
Predicted (-11.796112): think about how long you can learn how to live .
Ground Truth: from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
Predicted (-62.356945): and the way you can see the left @-@ hand side , and the muscles are the same as the way that we can see the mal@@ ignant and the patient &apos;s body .
Ground Truth: so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tre@@ m@@ or .
Predicted (-27.770435): and if you &apos;re in a small , you can see the same thing .
Src: wir sehen immer dieselben Symptome .
Ground Truth: we see all the same symptoms .
Predicted (-4.008912): we see the same thing .
Ground Truth: we see vocal tre@@ m@@ or , weakness and rigi@@ dity .
Predicted (-21.207508): the cl@@ ones , the bl@@ on@@ eness , the bl@@ on@@ eness .
Ground Truth: the speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
Predicted (-39.495819): and the body is a bit more nuanced and it &apos;s a bit more powerful than it &apos;s a speaker .
Ground Truth: so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
Predicted (-159.912033): so this is that the ability to read through the digital digital , and then you can see that there &apos;s no longer a lot of information , and that &apos;s why we can be able to do this , and then we can have a new memory of the brain , and it &apos;s a lot of de@@ par@@ able , and yet , in fact , that it &apos;s not just a lot of the same time .
Ground Truth: so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
Predicted (-46.545631): so , you can see that the same problem is not quite good at the same time , but they &apos;re not quite a clinical test .
Src: ebenso wenig . die Infrastruktur ist schon da .
Ground Truth: the neurolog@@ ist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
Predicted (-9.526488): so , it &apos;s very important .
Ground Truth: you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
Predicted (-9.229295): you don &apos;t have to build a new company .
Ground Truth: and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
Predicted (-10.216789): and they &apos;re not just the same thing .
Ground Truth: that means they can be self @-@ administ@@ ered .
Predicted (-8.747703): so you can see the same thing .
Src: sie sind sehr schnell , dauern maximal 30 Sekunden .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
Predicted (-16.103691): they &apos;re very fast , and you can see a few minutes .
Ground Truth: they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
Predicted (-14.775879): we &apos;re very good at it . and we &apos;re going to see this .
Ground Truth: when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
Predicted (-18.720427): if you &apos;re a very efficient way , it &apos;s very difficult to do it .
Ground Truth: so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
Predicted (-11.265126): so this is what we can do to achieve .
Ground Truth: we can reduce logi@@ stical difficulties with patients .
Predicted (-14.488496): we can do this with good treatment .
Ground Truth: no need to go to the clinic for a routine check@@ up .
Predicted (-18.673952): no one can do the patients in the lab .
Ground Truth: we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
Predicted (-13.855783): we can move through a completely different paradigm .
Ground Truth: we can perform low @-@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasi@@ ble for the first time .
Predicted (-36.198250): we can take a long @-@ term genome , and we &apos;ve been able to take the same results of the clinical trial .
Ground Truth: we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
Predicted (-27.412817): so we &apos;ve been able to take the evidence for the first time to get a drug .
Src: heute machen wir den ersten Schritt in diese Richtung , wir starten die Parkinson &apos; s @-@ Stimme @-@ Initiative .
Ground Truth: so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
Predicted (-28.918194): so let &apos;s take the first step in this game , and we &apos;ll go back to the next step .
Ground Truth: with A@@ cul@@ ab and Patient@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ Me , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
Predicted (-66.310379): so , for example , we have a number of children who are able to take a full @-@ scale record , and we have a full number of different components to get the same .
Ground Truth: we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Predicted (-33.144970): we have a half @-@ hour , and the small one @-@ line line that we have on the planet .
Ground Truth: anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Predicted (-63.405964): if you can get a little bit of a little bit , you can &apos;t have any extra phone , and we &apos;ve got to be able to do it with a few weeks ago .
Src: danke .
Ground Truth: thank you .
Predicted (-0.614740): thank you .
Src: wenn du Proben von , sagen wir 10.000 Menschen nimmst , kannst du dann sagen , wer von ihnen gesund ist und wer nicht ?
Ground Truth: so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
Predicted (-44.302567): if you take the people who are going to be treated and you know how to do that , and we &apos;re not going to be treated with them ?
Src: was werdet ihr mit all diesen Proben machen ?
Ground Truth: what are you going to get out of those samples ?
Predicted (-16.059814): what do you do with this little bit of the little bit ?
Ground Truth: yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
Predicted (-43.428558): and the problem is that if you take the patient &apos;s brain , you know , you know , you can &apos;t get a person to the doctor .
Src: manche werden es vielleicht nicht bis zum Ende schaffen .
Ground Truth: you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
Predicted (-9.138559): you can &apos;t even see it .
Ground Truth: but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ oning out the con@@ founding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
Predicted (-60.729996): but we find a lot of different changes , and this is a very important thing to do , because we &apos;re going to be able to do this , and this is what we call the most important thing .
Src: zurzeit besitzt ihr 86 Prozent Genauigkeit ?
Ground Truth: so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
Predicted (-20.014116): now , what does it mean is that the average of 40 percent ?
Src: sie ist viel besser .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s much better than that .
Predicted (-2.410696): it &apos;s much better .
Ground Truth: actually , my student Than@@ asis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Predicted (-84.437103): I &apos;m sure that this is a fantastic idea that it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done by this , because we &apos;ve been able to do this , and it &apos;s a fantastic way to bring the data out of the world .
Src: das nenne ich eine Verbesserung .
Ground Truth: ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
Predicted (-6.898973): I think that &apos;s a measure .
Ground Truth: so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Predicted (-77.467651): this is the question that you can take the phone , and you can see the person who can take the phone , and then send the phone to the phone , and you can get the money to the doctor &apos;s license .

Ground Truth: this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-12.349476): I &apos;m here in the middle of the country .
Ground Truth: those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Predicted (-21.295767): and the rest of the woods is the forest in the woods .
Ground Truth: Nairobi National Park is not fen@@ ced in the south widely , which means wild animals like ze@@ bras migrate out of the park freely .
Predicted (-54.983742): the second is the most effective thing in the south of the park is that we can do this in the wild , and the wild wild .
Ground Truth: so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
Predicted (-24.336243): the males , the females , and they are the ones that we &apos;re going to do .
Ground Truth: they kill our livestock .
Predicted (-5.310316): they kill our families .
Ground Truth: this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
Predicted (-43.119339): this is the morning , I was a dead accident . and it was the last night that I was in the snow .
Src: mein Stamm , der Stamm der Massa@@ i , glaubt , dass wir zusammen mit unseren Tieren und dem Wei@@ del@@ and vom Himmel kamen . deshalb bedeuten uns unsere Tiere so viel .
Ground Truth: my community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
Predicted (-50.497280): the one of the glaciers in the forest is that we go to the canopy and the elephant and the plants , and the other one is what we do .
Ground Truth: so I grew up hat@@ ing lions so much .
Predicted (-14.389708): and as a child , I was afraid to speak to shame .
Ground Truth: the mor@@ ans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
Predicted (-38.246845): the name is the root of our frogs , and they are the cause of the roots of our country .
Ground Truth: so they kill the lions .
Predicted (-3.572472): and they kill the lions .
Ground Truth: it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
Predicted (-25.656902): here is a man who &apos;s killed in the middle of the seven @-@ month .
Ground Truth: and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
Predicted (-19.605185): and I think that there &apos;s a lot of conservation in the forest .
Ground Truth: so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
Predicted (-34.617882): and my mother is a man who &apos;s in the forest , and he &apos;s still six months ago .
Ground Truth: so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
Predicted (-3.936803): I had to find a way .
Ground Truth: and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
Predicted (-8.196676): my first idea was to kill fire .
Ground Truth: but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-24.953629): but I realized that the aid would not be able to help us understand the threat .
Src: aber ich gab nicht auf . ich machte weiter .
Ground Truth: so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
Predicted (-8.586499): I didn &apos;t go . I did .
Src: ich hatte eine zweite Idee . ich versuchte es mit einer Vogel@@ scheu@@ che .
Ground Truth: and a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
Predicted (-20.405193): I was a second person . I thought I &apos;d do it with a bird .
Ground Truth: I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
Predicted (-27.922657): I thought that I would be the ones that were going to be the dog .
Ground Truth: but lions are very clever .
Predicted (-6.571909): but the lions are very dangerous .
Ground Truth: they will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
Predicted (-52.404465): you &apos;ll see the car coming up , and they &apos;re going to go back and look at the same time . and you &apos;re going to see that they &apos;re not going to be .
